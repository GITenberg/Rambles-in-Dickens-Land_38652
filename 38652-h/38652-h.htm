<h2><a name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
ix</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>It is one of the magic legacies left by the great romancers,
that the scenes and characters which they described should
possess for most of us an air of reality, so convincing as
sometimes to put staid history to the blush.&nbsp; The
novelist&rsquo;s ideals become actual to the popular mind; while
commonplace truth hides itself among its dry-as-dust records,
until some curious antiquary or insistent pedant drags it forth
to make a nine days&rsquo; wonder.&nbsp; We sigh over
&ldquo;Juliet&rsquo;s Tomb&rdquo; in spite of the precisians, sup
in the inn kitchen at Pennaflor with Gil Blas at our elbow, and
shudder through the small hours outside the haunted House of the
Black Cat in Quaker Philadelphia.&nbsp; At Tarascon they show you
Tartarin&rsquo;s oriental garden; and you must hide the
irrepressible smile, for Tartarin is painfully real to these good
cap-shooters.&nbsp; The other day an illustrated magazine
published pictures of Alexander Selkirk&rsquo;s birthplace, and
labelled them &ldquo;The Home of Robinson Crusoe.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The editor who chose that caption was still under the spell of
Defoe.&nbsp; To him, as to the vast majority, Crusoe the
imaginary seemed vividly real, while the flesh-and-blood Selkirk
was but a name.&nbsp; And <a name="pagex"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. x</span>if you have that catholic sympathy
which is the true test of the perfect lover of romance, read
&ldquo;David Copperfield&rdquo; once again, and then, by way of
experiment, spend an afternoon in Canterbury.&nbsp; You will find
yourself expecting at one moment to see Mr. Micawber step
jauntily out of the Queen&rsquo;s Head Inn, at another to catch a
glimpse of the red-haired Heep slinking along North Lane to his
&ldquo;&rsquo;umble dwelling.&rdquo;&nbsp; You will probably meet
a dozen buxom &ldquo;eldest Miss Larkinses,&rdquo; and obnoxious
butcher-boys&mdash;perhaps even a sweet Agnes Wickfield, or a
Miss Betsy Trotwood driving in from Dover.&nbsp; And, above all,
you will certainly enjoy yourself, and thank your gods for
Charles Dickens.</p>
<p>Mr. Would-be Wiseman may affect to sneer at our pilgrimages to
this and other places connected with the imaginary names of
fiction; but he must recognise the far-reaching influence for
good exercised by symbols and associations over the human
mind.&nbsp; The sight of a loved home after many years&mdash;the
flutter of one&rsquo;s country&rsquo;s flag in foreign
lands&mdash;these things touch keenly our better nature.&nbsp; In
a like manner is the thoughtful man impressed when he treads a
pathway hallowed by the writings of some favourite poet or
romancer.&nbsp; The moral lesson which the author intended to
convey, his insight into character or loving eye for
Nature&rsquo;s beauties, and many exquisite passages from his
books appeal to us all the more, when we recall them in the very
rooms where they were written&mdash;<a name="pagexi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xi</span>among the gloomy streets or breezy
hills which he has filled with his inventions.&nbsp; Says
Washington Irving in his essay on Stratford: &ldquo;I could not
but reflect on the singular gift of the poet; to be able thus to
spread the magic of his mind over the very face of Nature; to
give to things and places a charm and character not their own,
and to turn this &lsquo;working-day&rsquo; world into a perfect
fairyland.&nbsp; He is indeed the true enchanter, whose spell
operates, not upon the senses, but upon the imagination and the
heart.&nbsp; Under the wizard influence of Shakespeare I had been
walking all day in a complete delusion. . . .&nbsp; I had been
surrounded with fancied beings; with mere airy nothings conjured
up by poetic power; yet which, to me, had all the charm of
reality.&nbsp; I had heard Jaques soliloquise beneath his oak;
had beheld the fair Rosalind and her companion adventuring
through the woodlands; and, above all, had been once more present
in spirit with fat Jack Falstaff and his contemporaries, from the
august Justice Shallow down to the gentle Master Slender and the
sweet Anne Page.&nbsp; Ten thousand honours and blessings on the
bard who has thus gilded the dull realities of life with innocent
illusions.&rdquo;&nbsp; Wherefore, in spite of the sneers of
Master Would-be Wiseman, let us continue to make these pleasant
pilgrimages; not alone for our own satisfaction and betterment,
but also in memory of those who have opened before us so many
delectable lands of fancy, and given us so many agreeable
companions of the road.</p>
<p><a name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xii</span>This
volume, then, is the pilgrim&rsquo;s guide to Dickens&rsquo;
Land&mdash;the loving topography of that fertile and very
populous region.&nbsp; No far away foreign country is
Dickens&rsquo; Land.&nbsp; It lies at our doors; we may explore
it when we choose, with never a passport to purchase nor a Custom
House to fear.&nbsp; The sojourner in London can scarce look from
his windows without beholding scores of its interesting
places.&nbsp; To parody that passage which describes Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s outlook into Goswell Street&mdash;Dickens&rsquo;
Land is at our feet; Dickens&rsquo; Land is on our right hand as
far as the eye can reach; Dickens&rsquo; Land extends on our
left, and the opposite side of Dickens&rsquo; Land is over the
way.&nbsp; Nor do the bounds of this genial territory confine
themselves to London alone.&nbsp; Outlying portions spread north
and south, east and west, over England.&nbsp; There is even, as
Sala showed, a Dickens&rsquo; quarter in Paris; and we have
unexpectedly encountered small colonies of Dickens&rsquo; Land
across the wide Atlantic.&nbsp; But the best of it lies close to
the great heart of the world&mdash;in London, or in the counties
thereabout; and if &ldquo;Rambles in Dickens&rsquo; Land&rdquo;
succeeds in guiding its readers with pleasure and profit over
this storied ground, it will have faithfully fulfilled its
mission.</p>
<p>Trouble has not been spared to make this topography accurate
as well as entertaining.&nbsp; Mr. Weller the younger, with all
his &ldquo;extensive and peculiar&rdquo; knowledge of
London&mdash;Mr. Weller the elder and his brothers of the whip,
with <i>their</i> <a name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xiii</span>knowledge of post-roads and coaching inns, could
hardly have identified the various localities more clearly than
the compiler has done.&nbsp; Wherever doubts and disputes
arise&mdash;as in regard to the site of the &ldquo;Old Curiosity
Shop&rdquo;&mdash;all sides of the case are given, and the reader
is asked to sum up the arguments and judge for himself.&nbsp; In
nearly every instance a quotation is offered from the author, by
means of which the pilgrim is enabled to refresh his memory and
bring his own recollections of the book to bear upon the question
of the site.&nbsp; These quotations will be found to act
admirably as aids to memory, and to obviate the necessity of
carrying a whole library of Dickens about on one&rsquo;s
rambles.&nbsp; Take, for example, the excerpts from &ldquo;David
Copperfield&rdquo; in connection with the visit to Dover.&nbsp;
The facetious answers of the boatmen to David when, sitting
ragged and forlorn in the Dover Market Place, he inquires for his
aunt&rsquo;s house, bring back at a single touch the whole sad
story of the boy&rsquo;s tramp from London to the coast.&nbsp; It
does not require much imagination to picture him sitting there
&ldquo;on the step of an empty shop,&rdquo; with his weary,
pinched face and his &ldquo;dusty sunburnt, half-clothed
figure,&rdquo; while the sea-faring folk (lineal forbears of
those who frequent the place to-day) made mock of him with their
clumsy japes, until at length happened by the friendly
fly-driver, who showed him how to reach the residence of the old
lady who &ldquo;carries a bag&mdash;bag with a good deal of room
in it&mdash;is gruffish, and comes <a name="pagexiv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xiv</span>down upon you, sharp.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It is easy, too, with the help of our guide, to follow the
shivering child along the cliffs to Miss
Trotwood&rsquo;s&mdash;nay, to identify the &ldquo;very neat
little cottage, with cheerful bow-windows,&rdquo; where that good
soul looked after Mr. Dick, and defended her &ldquo;immaculate
grass-plot&rdquo; against marauding donkeys.&nbsp; It is this
present writer&rsquo;s privilege to know a charming elderly lady
who boasts of Dover as her birthplace, and who, when she has
exhausted the other lions of that town, is accustomed to close
her remarks with the statement that she &ldquo;lived for years
within a stone&rsquo;s-throw of Miss Betsy Trotwood&rsquo;s
cottage.&rdquo;&nbsp; Occasionally the Superior Person (who,
alas, is rarely absent nowadays!) points out with a smile of
tolerance that neither Miss Trotwood nor yet her house ever
existed save in the novelist&rsquo;s brain.&nbsp; Whereupon this
charming old lady shakes her finger testily at the transgressor,
and exclaims, &ldquo;It is quite evident that you have never
lived in Dover.&nbsp; Miss Betsy Trotwood a myth, indeed!&nbsp;
Let me tell you that my own mother knew the dear woman
well&mdash;yes, and that delightful Mr. Dick too; and she
remembered seeing Mr. Dickens drive up in a fly from the railway
station to visit them.&nbsp; Of course their names were not
&lsquo;Trotwood&rsquo; and &lsquo;Dick&rsquo; at all; it would
never have done for Mr. Dickens to put them in his book under the
real names, particularly as Mr. Dick was related to many good
families in that part of Kent.&nbsp; I have even a dim
recollection of seeing Miss Trotwood being wheeled about in a
bath-chair when <a name="pagexv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xv</span>I was a very little girl and she a very old woman.&nbsp;
Myth, indeed!&nbsp; Why, there are old men in Dover now who were
warned off the grass-plot by David Copperfield&rsquo;s aunt when
they were donkey-boys.&rdquo;&nbsp; The animation of the speaker
shows that she believes everything she says.&nbsp; Perhaps a lady
possessing the characteristics of Miss Betsy did once upon a time
inhabit the cottage in Dover.&nbsp; Perhaps there was a real Mr.
Dick.&nbsp; Otherwise these recollections are but another example
of that hypnotism exercised over posterity by the great
romancers, to which allusion has already been made.</p>
<p>Again, the many references and the quotations made from
several of Dickens&rsquo; works, illustrative of the Temple and
the Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn quarter&mdash;(pages 2 to 25 in the
ensuing &ldquo;Rambles&rdquo;)&mdash;are certain to be
appreciated by the Rambler.&nbsp; With their assistance he can
summon back to his memory the tender love story of Ruth Pinch,
and so dream away a happy hour in peaceful Fountain Court; follow
in fancy Maypole Hugh and the illustrious Captain Sim Tappertit
as they ascended the stairs to Sir John Chester&rsquo;s chambers
in Paper Buildings; stroll thoughtfully along King&rsquo;s Bench
Walk with the spirit of Sidney Carton; and, in the purlieus of
Chancery Lane, review the legal abuses of the past&mdash;(perhaps
even some of those that survive to-day)&mdash;reflect upon
&ldquo;Jarndyce and Jarndyce,&rdquo; or upon the banished
sponging-houses of this district, and once <a
name="pagexvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvi</span>more admit
that Dickens the great novelist was also Dickens the great
reformer.</p>
<p>An important feature of &ldquo;Rambles in Dickens&rsquo;
Land&rdquo; will be found in the exhaustive references to
Dickens&rsquo; own haunts and homes, and the haunts and homes of
many of his relatives and friends.&nbsp; Naturally, these are in
numerous cases intimately bound up with the creations of his
novels, for Dickens did not &ldquo;write out of an
inkwell,&rdquo; but looked for inspiration to real life and real
scenes.&nbsp; At Portsmouth our volume guides you to the house
where he was born, and to the old church register wherein the
christening is entered of&mdash;(how strangely the full name
sounds!)&mdash;&ldquo;Charles John Huffham Dickens.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But the same venerable seaport is thronged with memories of
Nicholas Nickleby and his player-friends, Miss Snevellicci, the
Crummles family, poor Smike and the rest.&nbsp; It is interesting
to remember that an American writer once suggested the
possibility that Dickens had obtained Nickleby&rsquo;s
experiences as an actor from personal adventures with a
travelling &ldquo;troupe&rdquo; during his youth.&nbsp; This is
not impossible, although Forster makes no mention of such an
adventure; the early years of Dickens are by no means fully
accounted for, and it is certain that the stage had always a
great fascination for him.</p>
<p>Back of old Hungerford Stairs, behind what is now Charing
Cross Station, you may visit the spot where the two
boys&mdash;the real and the imaginary&mdash;Charles Dickens and
David Copperfield <a name="pagexvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xvii</span>spent so many hours while working for a scant pittance
in that &ldquo;crazy old house with a wharf of its own abutting
on the water when the tide was in, and on the mud when it was
out, and literally overrun with rats.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gadshill,
where Dickens lived and died, is on the very borders of historic
Rochester, teeming with reminders of &ldquo;Edwin Drood,&rdquo;
not to say of the genial Pickwick and his companions.&nbsp; Of
Furnival&rsquo;s Inn where &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; was written,
and where its author spent the first months of his married life,
only the site remains; but these &ldquo;Rambles&rdquo; will help
you to find all, or nearly all, of his other homes, even to that
last home of all&mdash;the grave in Westminster Abbey, in which
he was laid on the 14th of June 1870.&nbsp; His friends&rsquo;
houses too, and the scores of spots noteworthy by reason of
association with him personally, you will be given an opportunity
of visiting if you follow this careful <i>cicerone</i>.&nbsp; At
No. 58 Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields still stands Forster&rsquo;s
house, where, in 1844, Dickens read &ldquo;The Chimes&rdquo; to
Carlyle, Douglas Jerrold, Maclise, and others, and which is also
utilised in &ldquo;Bleak House&rdquo; to supply a model for the
dwelling-place of Mr. Tulkinghorn.&nbsp; The office of
<i>Household Words</i>, founded by Dickens, is now part of the
Gaiety Theatre.&nbsp; The old taverns about Hampstead, whither he
loved to resort for a friendly flagon &ldquo;and a red-hot
chop,&rdquo; are much as they were in the novelist&rsquo;s day,
save in one regrettable instance where the proprietor has <a
name="pagexviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xviii</span>preferred, in order to cater to an unappreciative
class, to disfigure his inn into a mere modern public-house of
the conventional type, such that Dickens, who loved the place
when it was old-fashioned and comfortable, would utterly disown
now.&nbsp; The ancient &ldquo;Spaniards,&rdquo; however, is much
the same as it was in the days of the Gordon riots, when the then
host of the quaint little tavern saved Lord Mansfield&rsquo;s
country house at Caen Wood by allowing the rioters to devastate
his cellars, while he privily sent for the Guards.&nbsp; The
reckless waste of liquor on that occasion is said to have
suggested to Dickens the scene in &ldquo;Barnaby Rudge,&rdquo;
where John Willet watches the sack of his beloved
&ldquo;Maypole&rdquo; and sees his cellars drained of their best,
as he lies bound and helpless in the bar.&nbsp; That the novelist
frequently visited the &ldquo;Spaniards,&rdquo; the old records
of the house can show; and in &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; he makes it
the scene of a memorable tea-party, attended by Mrs. Bardell,
just before those &ldquo;sharp practitioners,&rdquo; Dodson and
Fogg, caused the injured lady&rsquo;s arrest.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Bull and Bush,&rdquo; another old Hampstead inn much
frequented of Dickens, also exists unharmed by the
&ldquo;renovator.&rdquo;&nbsp; And while we are upon the subject
of inns known to our author, let us not forget the
&ldquo;Maypole&rdquo; itself, here shown to be the
&ldquo;King&rsquo;s Head&rdquo; at Chigwell.&nbsp; Dickens was in
ecstasies over the &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Head&rdquo; and the
surrounding neighbourhood, when a chance visit disclosed to him
their <a name="pagexix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xix</span>attractions; and the letters which he wrote to his
friends at this period are full of Chigwell and its picturesque
hostelry.&nbsp; Little wonder, therefore, that he afterwards made
them famous in &ldquo;Barnaby Rudge.&rdquo;&nbsp; The pilgrim
will not be disappointed in the &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Head&rdquo;
of to-day, if he accepts the good advice offered by the compiler
of these &ldquo;Rambles,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> to take his ideal of
the place from Dickens&rsquo; own description rather than from
the elaborate drawing of Cattermole.&nbsp; He may perhaps notice
that in &ldquo;Barnaby Rudge&rdquo; no hint is conveyed of the
close proximity of Chigwell church, which is simply across the
road.&nbsp; Doubtless this is a sign of the novelist&rsquo;s
artistic sense.&nbsp; To have his &ldquo;Maypole&rdquo; windows
looking directly into the graveyard would have detracted from
that air of warmth and conviviality with which he wished to endow
his rare old inn.&nbsp; In most other respects the description
exactly fits the &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Head&rdquo; as it must have
been in &ldquo;No Popery&rdquo; times&mdash;as it is with little
alteration to-day.&nbsp; The trim green sward at the
rear&mdash;once evidently the bowling-green&mdash;is a famous
resting-place in summer; and in one of the small arbours Dickens
is said to have written during his stay here.&nbsp; The village,
although showing signs of the approach of that fell barbarian the
Essex builder, is still sufficiently picturesque and old-world to
keep one&rsquo;s illusions alive.&nbsp; There is a grammar school
at Chigwell, the boys of which are learned in neighbouring
Dickens&rsquo; lore.&nbsp; If you are <a name="pagexx"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xx</span>credulous&mdash;as it becomes a
pilgrim to be&mdash;these grammarians will show you John
Willet&rsquo;s tomb in the churchyard, and Dolly Varden&rsquo;s
path with the real Warren, on the skirts of Hainault Forest, at
the farther end of it.&nbsp; Both in Chigwell and Chigwell Row
some village worthies are still to be met with who have conversed
with Charles Dickens and the kindred spirits that came hither in
his company.&nbsp; At the &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Head,&rdquo; if Mr.
Willet&rsquo;s successor be agreeable, one may lunch or sup in
the Dickens&rsquo; Room, also held to have been the chamber in
which Mr. Haredale and the elder Chester held their memorable
interview.</p>
<p>Some other inns to which Dickens is known to have resorted
are: the &ldquo;Bull&rdquo; at Rochester, the &ldquo;Leather
Bottle&rdquo; at Cobham, and the &ldquo;Great White Horse&rdquo;
at Ipswich&mdash;all with Pickwickian associations; the
&ldquo;Old Cheshire Cheese&rdquo; in Fleet Street, and the
&ldquo;George and Dragon&rdquo; at Canterbury.&nbsp; To many
minor taverns in London he was also a frequent visitor, for he
sought his characters in the market-place rather than in the
study.&nbsp; His signature, with the familiar flourish
underneath, is treasured in hotel registers not a few, and it is
esteemed a high honour to be permitted to slumber in the
&ldquo;Dickens&rsquo; Room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To all and each of these places &ldquo;Rambles in
Dickens&rsquo; Land&rdquo; leads the way, if the reader chooses
to follow.&nbsp; A notable advantage of these rambles is the ease
with which they may be undertaken.&nbsp; An ordinary healthy man
or woman may set forth <a name="pagexxi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxi</span>without apprehension in the
author&rsquo;s footsteps from the beginning to the end of any
particular journey which he describes, and even the invalid may
saunter through a &ldquo;Ramble&rdquo; without fatigue.&nbsp;
Conveyances are only needed to bring the pilgrim to the
starting-point of the voyage, and in several instances even these
aids to locomotion may be dispensed with altogether when the
sightseer is one after Dickens&rsquo; own heart&mdash;a sturdy
pedestrian.&nbsp; By pursuing the routes indicated, there is no
reason why a Grand Tour of Dickens&rsquo; Land should not be made
by easy stages and at slight cost.&nbsp; Or the pilgrim may pick
out some particular trip, when leisure and chance carry him in
that direction.&nbsp; The volume is in truth a serviceable
guide-book, leading its clients by the best ways, and even
informing them where, when sight-seeing is over, a place may be
found for rest, refreshment, and reflection.&nbsp; And it is
happier than most guide-books in that it is never called upon to
describe the stupid and uninteresting, which have no existence in
Dickens&rsquo; Land.</p>
<p>Into Dickens&rsquo; Land, therefore, my masters, an you will
and when you will!&nbsp; The high-roads thither are always open,
the lanes and by-paths are free for us to tread.&nbsp; He that
found out this rare world has made it fully ours.&nbsp; Let us
visit our inheritance, or revisit it, if that be the better
word.&nbsp; Let us make real the scenes we have read of and
dreamt of&mdash;peopling them with the folk of Dickens, so that
familiar faces shall look upon us <a name="pagexxii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxii</span>from familiar windows, familiar
voices greet us as we pass.&nbsp; Shall we travel abroad in the
fashion of the corresponding committee of the Pickwick
Club?&nbsp; Then here is this book, with a wealth of shrewd
information between its covers, ready to be our own particular
Samuel Weller&mdash;to wear our livery, whether of sadness or of
joy&mdash;to point out to us the sights and the notabilities, to
be garrulous when we look for gossip, and silent when our mood is
for silence&mdash;to act, in short, as that useful individual
whom we all &ldquo;rayther want,&rdquo; &ldquo;somebody to look
arter us when we goes out a-wisitin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Where, if you please, shall we &ldquo;wisit&rdquo;
first?&nbsp; It is hard to choose, since there is so much to
choose from.&nbsp; We may ramble about London town, where, like
Mr. Weller, our guide is &ldquo;werry much at home.&rdquo;&nbsp;
If so, we are sure to encounter a host of old cronies.&nbsp;
Perhaps we shall see the great Buzfuz entering court, all in his
wig and silk, nodding with lofty condescension to his struggling
brother, Mr. T. Traddles, which latter is bringing &ldquo;Sophy
and the girls&rdquo; to set Gray&rsquo;s Inn a-blooming.&nbsp; Or
Tom Pinch going towards Fountain Court to meet the waiting
Ruth.&nbsp; Or David Copperfield joyously ushering J. Steerforth
into his rooms in the Adelphi.&nbsp; Or Captain Cuttle steering
for the sign of the &ldquo;Wooden Midshipman,&rdquo; which he may
eventually find (and make a note of) at its new moorings in the
Minories.&nbsp; Or Dick Swiveller, poor soul, loafing to his
dingy lodgings.&nbsp; Or that precious pair, Bob Sawyer and
Benjamin Allen, startling <a name="pagexxiii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxiii</span>the sullen repose of Lant Street
with bacchanalian revelry.</p>
<p>And, if the London Dickens&rsquo; Land palls, doth not this
most inviting country stretch to all points of the compass?&nbsp;
Northward goes yonder well-appointed coach, whereof the driver
has just been escorted from a certain public-house in Portugal
Street by a mottle-faced man, in company with two or three other
persons of stout and weather-beaten aspect&mdash;the driver
himself being stouter and more weather-beaten than all.&nbsp; Let
us take the box-seat by his side, and lead him on to talk of
&ldquo;shepherds in wolves&rsquo; clothing,&rdquo; until
presently he tools us into Ipswich, pulling up under the sign of
that &ldquo;rapacious animal&rdquo; the Great White Horse.&nbsp;
In Ipswich we may catch a glimpse of a mulberry-coloured livery
slinking by St. Clement&rsquo;s Church, and guess therefrom that
one Alfred Jingle is here at his old game of laying siege to the
hearts of susceptible females with money.&nbsp; Here, too, behind
that green gate in Angel Lane, resides the pretty housemaid soon
to become Mrs. Sam Weller.&nbsp; But we must not linger in
Ipswich.&nbsp; Yarmouth lies before us, with its phantom
boat-house still upturned on the waste places towards the sea,
with Little Em&rsquo;ly, and the Peggottys, and with Mr. Barkis
waiting in the Market Place to jog us out to sleepy
&ldquo;Blunderstone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back again in London, there is another coach-of-fancy prepared
to take us into Kent, from the yard of the Golden Cross.&nbsp;
Four gentlemen&mdash;one <a name="pagexxiv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxiv</span>a beaming, spectacled person in
drab shorts&mdash;are outside passengers for Rochester.&nbsp; And
see, here is the ubiquitous Jingle again, clambering to the roof
with all his worldly goods wrapped up in a brown paper
parcel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heads&mdash;heads&mdash;take care of your
heads,&rdquo; he cries, as we rumble under the old archway; and
then, hey! for hopfields and cherry orchards, for &ldquo;mouldy
old cathedrals&rdquo; in &ldquo;Cloisterham&rdquo; or Canterbury,
for jolly Kentish yeomen and bright-eyed maids of Kent. . .
.&nbsp; Who was that wan-faced, coatless urchin we passed just
now in a whirl of chalky dust?&nbsp; His name is Copperfield, and
he is on his way to Dover.&nbsp; And is not that Mr. Wardle
driving his laughing women-folk to the review?&nbsp; And again,
yonder on the brown common, by the Punch and Judy show, there is
a grey old man, pillowing in his loving arms a little blue-eyed
girl.&nbsp; These, too, we know; and our hearts go out to them,
for who of us is there that has not&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;. . . with Nell, in Kentish meadows,<br />
Wandered, and lost his way&rdquo;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of introduction there is no more to be said.&nbsp; The book
itself lies open before you; and at your own sweet will you may
ramble with it, high and low, through all the land of
Dickens.</p>

<h2><a name="pagexxv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxv</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p>The great majority of English readers&mdash;on both sides of
the Atlantic&mdash;claim personal acquaintance with
&ldquo;Samivel&rdquo; Weller, Mark Tapley, Oliver Twist, and many
more besides: the old companions of our schoolboy days.&nbsp; We
cherish pleasant remembrance of the familiar &ldquo;green
leaves&rdquo; of Dombey, David Copperfield, and the rest, as they
first afforded us their monthly quota of interest and enjoyment;
and have always maintained intimate relations with Captain
Cuttle, Tom Pinch, Mr. Peggotty, and the more recent <i>dramatis
person&aelig;</i> of the works of Dickens.&nbsp; We sympathise
with Florence, Agnes, and Esther as with sisters, and keep
corners of our hearts sacred to the memory of Little Nell, Paul
Dombey, and the child-wife Dora.</p>
<p>The creations of &ldquo;bonnie Prince Charlie&rdquo; have thus
become veritable &ldquo;household words&rdquo;; part and parcel
of our home associations, instinct with personality and
life.&nbsp; We never think of them as the airy nothings of
imaginative fiction, but regard them as familiar friends, having
&ldquo;a local habitation and a name&rdquo; amongst us; with
whose cheerful acquaintance we could ill afford to part, and who
bear us kindly company on the hot and dusty highway of our daily
lives.</p>
<p>Charles Dickens was essentially a Londoner, always having a
fond regard for the highways and by-ways of this great
Metropolis, and confessedly deriving his inspiration from the
varied phases of Town life and Society.&nbsp; We accordingly find
that the main incidents and characters of his novels have here
their <i>mise en sc&egrave;ne</i>.</p>
<p>In homage to the genius of his favourite Author, the <a
name="pagexxvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxvi</span>writer of
the following pages has endeavoured to localise many of the more
familiar associations of the great Novelist with as much
exactitude as may be possible; but it must be remembered that
London has undergone considerable alteration and reconstruction,
during the last fifty years.</p>
<p>Thus far reads the original Preface to this Work, as written
thirteen years since; the first (and smaller) edition of which
was published in 1886, under the title of <i>Rambles in London
with Charles Dickens</i>.&nbsp; The author now begs to thankfully
acknowledge its favourable reception, generously accorded by the
Press in particular, and the reading-world in general.</p>
<p>The present arrangement of the book includes some important
additions as well as considerable revision, the latter being
rendered necessary by the <i>disappearance</i> of many houses and
buildings in the course of intervening years, and the steady
progress of Metropolitan improvements.&nbsp; Thus it comes to
pass that only the memory of what has been remains, in regard to
many of these Dickensian localities and landmarks; and it has
been the object of the author (1899) to indicate the former
whereabouts of these old places, as heretofore existent.&nbsp;
Especially in the Strand and neighbourhood (Ramble I.), as well
as in Chancery Lane and Holborn (Rambles II. and IV.), many
alterations have taken place, and another London is springing up
around a younger generation, not known to Dickens.&nbsp; Our
Author says (in <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>), &ldquo;Change begets
change; nothing propagates so fast&rdquo;: and the London of
to-day, and the activities of our Metropolitan County Council, at
the close of this nineteenth century, afford striking testimony
to the truth of the aphorism, &ldquo;The old order changeth,
giving place to new.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Pall Mall Magazine</i>, July 1896, contains a
contribution by Mr. C. Dickens, junr.&mdash;&ldquo;Notes on Some
Dickens&rsquo; Places and People&rdquo;&mdash;in which he
deprecates the endeavours of those inquirers who have attempted
any localisation of these places.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;that <a name="pagexxvii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxvii</span>many of the places described in
Charles Dickens&rsquo;s books were suggested by real localities
or buildings, but the more the question comes to be examined, the
more clear it is that all that was done with the prototype, was
to use it as a painter or a sculptor uses a sketch, and that,
under the hand of the writer and in the natural process of
evolution, it has grown, in almost every case, into a finished
picture, with few, if any, very salient points about it to render
its origin unmistakable.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also quotes, with
emphatic approval, from a review of Mr. P. Fitzgerald&rsquo;s
<i>Bozland</i>, then recently published: &ldquo;Dickens, like
Turner in the sister art of painting&mdash;like all real artists
indeed&mdash;used nature, no doubt, but used it as being his
slave and in no wise his master.&nbsp; He was not content simply
to reproduce the places, persons, things that he had seen and
known.&nbsp; He passed them through the crucible of his
imagination, fused them, re-combined their elements, changed them
into something richer and rarer, gave them forth as products of
his art.&nbsp; Are we not doing him some disservice when we try
to reverse the process?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;With these words I
most cordially agree.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Charles Dickens
the Younger</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The author of this book would submit that the attempt to
preserve the memory of these localities in association with their
original use by &ldquo;the Master,&rdquo; does <i>not</i>
&ldquo;reverse the process&rdquo;; but, rightly considered, may
help the reader to a better comprehension of the genius and
method of Dickens.&nbsp; The dictum of the Rev. W. J. Dawson,
given a few years since in <i>The Young Woman</i> (referring to a
previous edition of this Work), is worth consideration:
&ldquo;The book casts a new light upon Dickens&rsquo;s methods of
work, and shows us how little he left to invention, and how much
he owed to exact observation.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in this connection
there may be quoted the opinion of Sir Walter Besant, who
published an appreciative article in <i>The Queen</i>, 9th May
1896, anent these selfsame &ldquo;Rambles,&rdquo; which thus
concludes: &ldquo;With this information in your hand, you can go
down the Strand and view its streets <a
name="pagexxviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxviii</span>from
north to south with increased intelligence and interest.&nbsp; I
am not certain whether peopling a street with creations of the
imagination is not more useful&mdash;it is certainly more
interesting&mdash;than with the real figures of the stony-hearted
past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The writer, therefore, still believes that such a Dickensian
Directory as is now prepared will be found a valuable practical
guide for those who may desire to visit the haunts and homes of
these old friends, whose memory we cannot &ldquo;willingly let
die;&rdquo; and to recall the many interests connected with them
by the way.</p>
<p>Though not professing to be infallible, he begs to assure
those whom it may concern that his information&mdash;gleaned from
many sources&mdash;has been collected <i>con amore</i> with
carefulness and caution; and he ventures to hope that his book
may be of service to many Metropolitan visitors, as indicating
(previous to the coming time when the New Zealander shall
meditate over the ruins of London) some few pleasant
&ldquo;Rambles in Dickens&rsquo; Land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Starting from <span class="smcap">Charing Cross Post
Office</span> as a convenient centre, and taking an eastward
course up the Strand, we immediately reach, on the left-hand
(north) side&mdash;a few doors from the Post Office&mdash;<b>The
Golden Cross Hotel</b>.&nbsp; Sixty years since this <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>establishment
was one of the principal Coaching Houses of the Metropolis.&nbsp;
It was the starting-point of the Rochester Coach, by which, on
May 13, 1827, <i>Mr. Pickwick</i> and his friends commenced their
travels.&nbsp; Driving by cab from the vicinity of that
gentleman&rsquo;s residence in Goswell Street, here it was that
the pugnacious cabman, having mistaken the purpose of Mr.
P.&rsquo;s note-book, committed assault and battery upon the four
Pickwickians, &ldquo;sparring away like clockwork,&rdquo; from
which unexpected attack they were rescued by the redoubtable
<i>Mr. Alfred Jingle</i>.&nbsp; In those days there was an arched
entrance leading from the Strand beneath the front of the hotel
to the coach-yard behind.&nbsp; Hence Mr. Jingle&rsquo;s warning
to his new acquaintances&mdash;&ldquo;Heads, heads; take care of
your heads!&rdquo; which recommendation was followed by the first
recorded anecdote as given by that loquacious
pretender&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Terrible place&mdash;dangerous
work&mdash;other day&mdash;five children&mdash;mother&mdash;tall
lady, eating sandwiches&mdash;forgot the
arch&mdash;crash&mdash;knock&mdash;children look
round&mdash;mother&rsquo;s head off&mdash;sandwich in her
hand&mdash;no mouth to put it in&mdash;head of a family
off&mdash;shocking&mdash;shocking.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This coach-yard and its entrance existed until the days of
<i>Copperfield</i>, who came to <span class="smcap">The Golden
Cross</span> in the nineteenth chapter of his history, having
just finished his education at Dr. Strong&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He
arrived &ldquo;outside the Canterbury Coach,&rdquo; and here met
<i>Steerforth</i>, his former schoolboy patron, who speedily
arranged for his transference from No. 44, &ldquo;a little loft
over a stable,&rdquo; to No. 72, a comfortable bedroom next his
own.&nbsp; Here, says David, &ldquo;I fell asleep in blissful
condition . . . until the early morning coaches rumbling out of
<i>the archway underneath</i> made me dream of thunder and the
gods.&rdquo;&nbsp; This entrance was abolished in 1851, giving
place to a more convenient exterior arrangement and doorway;
again remodelled, 1897.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Golden Cross</span> is again referred
to in the Copperfield experience (chapter 40) as the place where
David conferred with <i>Mr. Peggotty</i>, one snowy night, after
their <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>unexpected meeting opposite St. Martin&rsquo;s Church
(close at hand on the north, at the corner of St. Martin&rsquo;s
Lane), when <i>Martha</i> listened at the door.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In those days there was a side
entrance&rdquo; (Duncannon Street, now appropriated by the London
and North-Western Railway Company) &ldquo;nearly opposite to
where we stood.&nbsp; I pointed out the gateway, put my arm
through his, and we went across.&nbsp; Two or three public rooms
opened out of the stable-yard; and looking into one of them, and
finding it empty, and a good fire burning, I took him in
there.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Opposite the principal entrance of <span class="smcap">The
Golden Cross</span> is <b>Craven Street</b>, leading to the
Thames Embankment.&nbsp; It now mainly consists of private hotels
and boarding-houses, at which visitors to London may be
conveniently accommodated on reasonable terms.&nbsp; In the days
of <i>Oliver Twist</i> these were, for the most part, private
houses; and here was <span class="smcap">Mr. Brownlow&rsquo;s
Residence</span>&mdash;taken after his removal from
Pentonville&mdash;in which was the back parlour where full
confession was extorted from <i>Monks</i>, <i>alias Edward
Leeford</i>.&nbsp; The house, No. 39 (now <i>Barnett&rsquo;s
Private Hotel</i>), centrally situated on the east side, is
stated to have been assigned as the residence aforesaid.</p>
<p>On the south side of the Strand we immediately reach the
<b>Charing Cross Terminus</b> of the South-Eastern Railway, built
on the site of old Hungerford Market.&nbsp; At No. 30
<b>Hungerford Stairs</b>, at the back of this locality, Charles
Dickens, when a lad, did duty at the Blacking Manufactory of a
relative, by name James Lamert, at a salary of six or seven
shillings a week, as his first employment in life.&nbsp; It was
the last house on the left-hand side of the way, a crazy,
tumble-down old place abutting on the river.&nbsp; Here his work
was to cover and label the pots of paste-blacking.&nbsp; To this
episode of his youthful experience he refers in the history of
&ldquo;David Copperfield,&rdquo; chapter 11, David becoming
&ldquo;a labouring hind&rdquo; in the service of <i>Messrs.
Murdstone and Grinby</i>.&nbsp; In old Hungerford Market, too,
was <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span><span
class="smcap">The Chandler&rsquo;s Shop</span> over which <i>Mr.
Peggotty</i> slept on the night of his first arrival in London;
the bedroom being afterwards appropriated by Mr. Dick.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There was a low wooden colonnade before the
door, which pleased Mr. Dick mightily.&nbsp; The glory of lodging
over this structure would have compensated him for many
inconveniences. . . .&nbsp; He was perfectly charmed with his
accommodation.&nbsp; Mrs. Crupp had indignantly assured him that
there wasn&rsquo;t room to swing a cat there; but, as Mr. Dick
justly observed, &lsquo;You know, Trotwood, I don&rsquo;t want to
swing a cat.&nbsp; I never do swing a cat.&nbsp; Therefore, what
does that signify to me!&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;See
&ldquo;Copperfield,&rdquo; chapters 32 and 35.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Hungerford</span> is also mentioned in the
same book (chapter 57) as the place where, previous to their
departure for Australia, the <span class="smcap">Micawber
Family</span> had lodgings &ldquo;in a little, dirty, tumble-down
public-house, which in those days was close to the stairs, and
whose protruding wooden rooms overhung the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By a parallel street near at hand (next turning on the left of
the Strand&mdash;Agar Street) we come into Chandos Street, where
are situated the large stores of the Civil Service Supply
Association, which, during recent years, have been enlarged,
extending westward in Chandos Street.&nbsp; This extension
occupies the former site of No. 3, whilom a chemist&rsquo;s shop,
kept by a Mr. Wellspring.&nbsp; Here, in the days that are gone,
was established a second warehouse of Lamert&rsquo;s blacking
trade, the business being removed in course of time to this
address; and here Dickens, with other lads, was often busily
employed near the window.&nbsp; They acquired such dexterity in
finishing off the pots, that many persons would stand outside,
looking on with interest at the performance.</p>
<p>On the opposite side of Chandos Street is
<i>Bedfordbury</i>&mdash;a northward thoroughfare leading to New
Street, Covent Garden&mdash;on the right of which stands a range
of five large five-storied blocks known as <i>Peabody&rsquo;s
Buildings</i>.&nbsp; These afford respectable accommodation for
artizans.&nbsp; This was the locality of <b>Tom
All-Alone&rsquo;s</b>, that wretched rookery of evil repute in <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>the days of
<i>Poor Joe</i>, as described in chapter 16 of &ldquo;Bleak
House.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, in these degenerate times, the black,
dilapidated streets and tumbling tenements have given place to
wholesome dwellings, and the neighbourhood is associated with the
name of a great American philanthropist.</p>
<p>Returning to the south side of the Strand, we next come to
<b>Buckingham Street</b> (turning on right, by No. 37), at the
end house of which, on the right, facing the river, was the top
set of chambers in the Adelphi, consisting of</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A little half-blind entry, where you could
hardly see anything, a little stone-blind pantry, where you could
see nothing at all, a sitting-room and a bedroom.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here <i>David Copperfield</i> for some time resided under the
housekeeping supervision of Mrs. Crupp, and the residence was
afterwards shared by <i>Miss Betsy Trotwood</i>.&nbsp; At the
next turning in the Strand&mdash;by No. 64, same side of the
way&mdash;we arrive at Durham Street, which leads to the no
thoroughfare of <b>The Adelphi Arches</b>, about and through
which the lad Charles Dickens loved in his leisure time to
roam.&nbsp; David Copperfield says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I was fond of wandering about the Adelphi,
because it was a mysterious place, with those dark arches.&nbsp;
I see myself emerging one evening from one of these arches, on a
little public-house, close to the river, with an open space
before it, where some coal-heavers were dancing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of this place more anon.</p>
<p>Continuing our onward journey, we come to Adam Street
(right-hand turning by No. 72), looking down which may be seen,
at the corner of John Street, <span class="smcap">The Adelphi
Hotel</span>.&nbsp; This hotel was known in the days of Pickwick
as <b>Osborn&rsquo;s Hotel</b>, <b>Adelphi</b>.&nbsp; To this
establishment, it will be remembered, came <i>Mr. Wardle</i>,
visiting London with his daughter Emily, after Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s release from the Fleet Prison, also accompanied
by his trusty retainer, <i>the fat boy</i>, <i>Joe</i>.&nbsp; The
last plate but one in the book illustrates <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>the plan
adopted by <i>Mary</i> when inducing that intelligent youth to
observe a discreet silence as to the visit of Mr. Snodgrass to
his young mistress at this hotel; and we may recollect the
<i>contretemps</i> which afterwards took place here at
dinner-time, involving the detention of the clandestine lover,
and resulting in a very satisfactory
<i>d&eacute;nouement</i>.&mdash;See &ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo;
chapter 54.</p>
<p>Passing the next block onwards, we arrive at the handsome
frontage of the <span class="smcap">Hotel Cecil</span>.&nbsp; In
former days, at western corner of same, close to No. 75, there
existed a narrow and precipitous passage which was formerly the
approach to the halfpenny boats.&nbsp; It led to a little
public-house, &ldquo;<b>The Fox-under-the-Hill</b>,&rdquo; for a
long time shut up and in ruinous condition&mdash;once situated on
the water-side, the site of which is now covered by the west wing
of the Hotel Cecil.</p>
<p>This place is spoken of in Mr. Forster&rsquo;s Biography as
being one of our author&rsquo;s <i>favourite localities</i>, and
referred to in &ldquo;Copperfield,&rdquo; as before mentioned, in
connection with the Adelphi Arches.&nbsp; This, then, was
doubtless the tavern at which <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>,
<i>junr.</i>, was accommodated, on his arrival in London,
&ldquo;in the humbler regions of the Adelphi;&rdquo; and where he
was unexpectedly visited by <i>Mark Tapley</i>, who then and
there became his &ldquo;nat&rsquo;ral born servant, hired by
fate,&rdquo; and his very faithful friend.&mdash;See
&ldquo;Martin Chuzzlewit,&rdquo; chapter 13.</p>
<p>Farther onwards, on the same side, towards the centre of the
Strand, there stood near Savoy Street the house which in all
probability was the <b>Residence of Miss La Creevy</b>.&nbsp; It
will be recollected that Ralph Nickleby, visiting his relations
at this address in the Strand, is described as stopping</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At a private door, about halfway down that
crowded thoroughfare.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. 111 was an old-fashioned house in just such a position,
with a private door&mdash;a somewhat unusual convenience <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>in the
Strand.&nbsp; A photographer&rsquo;s case had, for many years,
displaced the &ldquo;large gilt frame screwed upon the street
door,&rdquo; in which Miss La Creevy aforetime displayed her
painted miniatures.&nbsp; The place has been pulled down,
together with the adjoining house.&nbsp; Handsome modern business
premises are erected on the double site.&mdash;See
&ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby,&rdquo; chapter 2.</p>
<p>We now cross to the north side of the Strand, and take the
next turning on the left, <i>Wellington Street North</i>.&nbsp;
Passing the Lyceum Theatre, we may note, on the opposite side,
the offices of the Gaiety Theatre, No. 16.&nbsp; For many years
this was the <b>Office of</b> &ldquo;<b>Household
Words</b>&rdquo;; this well-known miscellany being started under
the conductorship of Charles Dickens, March 30, 1850.</p>
<p>It was afterwards removed to No. 26, higher up, on the same
side of the way, at which address the later issue of <i>All the
Year Round</i> was published, as conducted by Charles Dickens,
the son.</p>
<p>Proceeding a short distance onwards, and turning to the left,
we come into the precincts of <b>Covent Garden Market</b>.&nbsp;
At the south corner of <i>Russell Street</i> we may note the
position of the old <span class="smcap">Hummums Hotel</span>,
mentioned in &ldquo;Great Expectations&rdquo; as the place where
Pip slept, in accordance with the warning received from Mr.
Wemmick&mdash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The present establishment was erected on the site of the
former hotel (as it stood in the days of Mr. Pip&rsquo;s
sojourn), 1892; on completion of the new Flower Market, <span
class="smcap">The Tavistock Hotel</span>, Piazzas, on the north
side of the market, was the house at which were held the
fortnightly meetings of &ldquo;The Finches of the Grove,&rdquo;
Herbert Pocket and Mr. Pip being members of the Club known by
this appellation in the book above mentioned.&nbsp; The end and
aim of this institution seemed to be &ldquo;that the members
should dine expensively once a fortnight, to quarrel among
themselves as much as possible after dinner, and to cause six
waiters to get drunk on the stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>A general
description of <i>Covent Garden</i> will be found in
&ldquo;Little Dorrit&rdquo; (chapter 14), and a graphic reference
to &ldquo;the seamy side&rdquo; of this locality is contained in
the pages of &ldquo;Our Mutual Friend&rdquo; (chapter 9, Book
4).</p>
<p>Returning by Russell Street, we soon reach <i>Bow Street</i>,
and on the left may observe an open space contiguous to the
<i>Foreign Fruit Market</i>.&nbsp; On this space there stood No.
4, in recent times occupied by Mr. Stinchcombe, costumier.&nbsp;
Some years since this was the situation of <b>Bow Street Police
Court</b>, now removed to the handsome new building facing Covent
Garden Theatre.&nbsp; This, therefore, was the place at which the
<i>Artful Dodger</i>, when committed for trial by the presiding
magistrate, thus reserved his defence:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t the shop for justice;
besides which my attorney is a-breakfasting this morning with the
Vice-President of the House of Commons; but I shall have
something to say elsevere, and so will he, and so will a wery
numerous and respectable circle of acquaintances, as&rsquo;ll
make them beaks wish they&rsquo;d never been
born.&rdquo;&mdash;See &ldquo;Oliver Twist,&rdquo; chapter
43.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At a short distance onwards, we may note <b>Covent Garden
Theatre</b>, selected by David Copperfield as his first place of
entertainment in London, after dinner at the Golden Cross
Hotel&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Being then in a pleasant frame of mind . .
. I resolved to go to the play.&nbsp; It was Covent Garden
Theatre that I chose; and there, from the back of a centre box, I
saw &ldquo;Julius C&aelig;sar&rdquo; and the new pantomime.&nbsp;
To have all those noble Romans alive before me, and walking in
and out for my entertainment, instead of being the stern
taskmasters they had been at school, was a most novel and
delightful effect.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This theatre, as attended by David, was destroyed by fire
March 4, 1856, six years after his autobiography was published,
and afterwards rebuilt.</p>
<p>Exactly opposite the fa&ccedil;ade of the theatre is <b>Broad
Court</b>, past the new magisterial building above referred
to.&nbsp; This was the location given by <i>Mr. Snevellicci</i>
(at Portsmouth), on a convivial occasion, described in <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>&ldquo;Nicholas
Nickleby&rdquo; (chapter 30), as his London address:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am not ashamed of myself; Snevellicci is
my name.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m to be found in Broad Court, Bow Street,
when I&rsquo;m in town.&nbsp; If I&rsquo;m not at home, let any
man ask for me at the stage-door.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is also historical reference to <i>Bow Street</i> in
&ldquo;Barnaby Rudge,&rdquo; as the place where &ldquo;another
boy was hanged,&rdquo; after the suppression of the Gordon
riots.</p>
<p>Exactly facing the north end of Bow Street, which gives into
Long Acre, is a large building, now a stationer&rsquo;s
warehouse, recently used as the Clergy Co-operative Stores.&nbsp;
Thirty-five years since this site was occupied by <b>St.
Martin&rsquo;s Hall</b>, in which Dickens gave his first series
of paid readings in London (sixteen nights), under the management
of Mr. Arthur Smith, 1858.&nbsp; The hall was a short time
afterwards burnt down, and the Queen&rsquo;s Theatre was here
erected in its stead by Mr. Wigan; which theatre was since
converted to the commercial uses of the Clergy as aforesaid.</p>
<p>Proceeding up <i>Long Acre</i> to <i>Drury Lane</i>, we turn
to the right, and in five minutes pass the back of Drury Lane
Theatre.&nbsp; The second turning on the same side is <span
class="smcap">Russell Court</span>, a narrow passage leading to
Catherine Street.&nbsp; The entire area between the two streets,
for some distance, is cleared for building improvements, so that
the indications immediately following refer to the past, and not
practically to the present.&nbsp; These things have been, but are
not.</p>
<p>In this court, about halfway on the right, was to be found
(until 1897) the entrance to what was once the pauper <b>Burial
Ground</b> where Captain Hawdon&mdash;known as <i>Nemo</i> in the
pages of &ldquo;Bleak House&rdquo;&mdash;was interred, and where
Lady Dedlock was afterwards found dead at the gateway, she having
fled from her husband, Sir Leicester, in despair, dreading the
<i>expos&eacute;</i> threatened by Mr. Tulkinghorn.&nbsp; It is
also associated with <i>Poor Jo</i>, the
crossing-sweeper.&mdash;See &ldquo;Bleak House,&rdquo; chapters
11 and 59.</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>&ldquo;With houses looking on, on every side, save where
a reeking little tunnel of a court gives access to the iron
gate&mdash;with every villainy of life in action close on death,
and every poisonous element of death in action close on
life&mdash;here, they lower our dear brother down a foot or two:
here, sow him in corruption, to be raised in incorruption: an
avenging ghost at many a sick bedside: a shameful testimony to
future ages, how civilisation and barbarism walked this boastful
island together.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This intermural graveyard was attached to the Church of St.
Mary-le-Strand, and has been closed for many years.&nbsp; The
enclosure was converted into a recreation ground, and formally
opened as such by Lady George Hamilton, May 19, 1886, on behalf
of the Metropolitan Public Garden Association.&nbsp; But the
entire locality is changed, the &ldquo;avenging ghost&rdquo; has
ceased to walk, and the &ldquo;shameful testimony&rdquo; has
ended.</p>
<p>At a short distance in Drury Lane, towards the Strand, we turn
(left) by No. 106, into <b>Clare Court</b>, referred to in
Forster&rsquo;s Biography as follows&mdash;(C.D.
<i>loq.</i>):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Once, I remember tucking my own bread
(which I had brought from home in the morning) under my arm,
wrapped up in a piece of paper like a book, and going into the
best dining-room in Johnson&rsquo;s <i>a la mode</i> beef-house
in Clare Court, Drury Lane, and magnificently ordering a small
plate of <i>a la mode</i> beef to eat with it.&nbsp; What the
waiter thought of such a strange little apparition, coming in all
alone, I don&rsquo;t know, but I can see him now, staring at me
as I ate my dinner, and bringing up the other waiter to
look.&nbsp; I gave him a halfpenny, and I wish now that he
hadn&rsquo;t taken it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This episode of the author&rsquo;s experience as a poor boy in
London was reproduced in &ldquo;David Copperfield,&rdquo; chapter
11.&nbsp; The dining-house mentioned then existed (1824) at No.
13 in the court, in a prominent corner position.&nbsp; It has
been unknown to fame for the last thirty years.</p>
<p>Returning by Drury Court to the Strand, and passing on the
south side of the church above mentioned, we turn by No. 162<span
class="smcap">a</span> into <i>Strand Lane</i>, where may be
visited, at No. 5, <b>The Old Roman Bath</b> referred to by David
Copperfield, who says, &ldquo;In which I have had many a cold
plunge.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>(See chapter 35.)&nbsp; The bath
itself is lined with white marble, and dates from the sixteenth
century.&nbsp; It is supplied from an old Roman reservoir
adjoining, about 2000 years old.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Passing Surrey Street, just beyond, we come (next on the
right) to <i>Norfolk Street</i>, in which there may be noted the
former whereabouts of <span class="smcap">Mrs. Lirriper&rsquo;s
Lodgings</span>; and we may here recall the pleasant associations
connected with the Christmas numbers of <i>All the Year
Round</i>, 1863 and 1864.&nbsp; The houses in this street are not
enumerated beyond forty-five, all told.&nbsp; The figures 81, as
given in the tale referred to, should be <i>reversed</i>; but sad
to relate, No. 18&mdash;long standing as an old-fashioned
boarding-house on the western side, below Howard Street&mdash;has
disappeared, and certain modern buildings, offices, etc.,
recently erected, now occupy the old site.&nbsp; At a short
distance farther on, in a central position in the Strand, stands
the church of <b>St. Clement Danes</b>.&nbsp; It is of interest
in this connection as the scene of Mrs. Lirriper&rsquo;s wedding,
some forty years previous to the narration of her business
experience; and where she still retained &ldquo;a sitting in a
very pleasant pew, with genteel company, and her own hassock,
being partial to evening service, not too crowded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Retracing our steps, three minutes, to the Church of St.
Mary-le-Strand, again leaving the Strand by <i>Newcastle</i> and
<i>Houghton Streets</i>, and turning left and right (leaving
Clare Market on the left), we shortly arrive at <i>Portsmouth
Street</i>, <i>Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields</i>.&nbsp; At No. 14
will be found (for a short time only) a small old-fashioned
house, on the front of which is painted an inscription,
&ldquo;<b>The Old Curiosity Shop</b>, <i>Immortalised by Charles
Dickens</i>,&rdquo; now occupied by Mr. H. Poole, dealer in
wastepaper.&nbsp; This is said to be the house assigned by the
novelist for the residence of Little Nell and her grandfather,
with whose pathetic history we are all familiar&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One of those receptacles for old and
curious things, which seem to crouch in odd corners of this town,
and to hide their musty treasures from the public eye in jealousy
and distrust.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>It
cannot, however, be regarded as absolutely certain that this
particular house was the author&rsquo;s intended &ldquo;local
habitation&rdquo; for one of the best-known and loved of his
creations.&nbsp; The tale itself concludes with a reference to
<i>Kit&rsquo;s</i> uncertainty as to the whereabouts of the
place:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The old house had long ago been pulled
down, and a fine broad road was in its place.&nbsp; At first he
would draw with his stick a square upon the ground to show them
where it used to stand.&nbsp; But he soon became uncertain of the
spot, and could only say it was thereabouts, he thought, and that
these alterations were confusing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[A lady, personally acquainted with the great novelist, has
informed the author that she was once taken by Mr. Dickens to No.
10 Green Street (approaching Leicester Square from the
east)&mdash;at the corner of Green and Castle Streets, behind the
National Gallery&mdash;the business of curiosity-dealing being
then and there carried on.&nbsp; Mr. Dickens himself localised
this house as the home of little Nell, pointing out an inner
room&mdash;divided from the shop by a glass partition&mdash;as
her bedroom.&nbsp; The premises are now rebuilt.]</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>At a short distance from this locality, and at an opposite
angle of the street, there existed (until 1898) one of the
old-fashioned taverns of the metropolis.&nbsp; The house was
noteworthy, with its overhanging front resting on rough wooden
pillars, and was named <i>Old George IVth</i>.</p>
<p>It is now replaced by a newly-built house of the same name, in
modern style of plate glass, mahogany, and glitter.</p>
<p>It is highly probable that the old tavern represented the
location and character of &ldquo;<b>The Magpie and
Stump</b>,&rdquo; the rendezvous of <i>Mr. Lowten</i>
(Perker&rsquo;s clerk) and other choice spirits in the days of
Pickwick.&nbsp; It is described in the Pickwickian history as
being near Clare Market, at the back of New Inn, and to this
position the &ldquo;Old George IVth&rdquo; will correspond.&nbsp;
Joe Miller, of jocular celebrity, was, aforetime, a frequenter of
this establishment, when his quips &ldquo;were wont to set the
table in a roar.&rdquo;&nbsp; His seat was still shown in the bar
of the old house.&nbsp; Dickens and Thackeray were also well <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>remembered as
visitors to this ancient hostelry.&nbsp; There is now a
&ldquo;Magpie and Stump&rdquo; in Fetter Lane, at some distance
hence; but it is evident that Dickens transferred the name to a
tavern in this neighbourhood.&nbsp; It will be remembered that
here Mr. Pickwick enjoyed an hour&rsquo;s entertainment,
listening to the legends of &ldquo;those curious old
nooks,&rdquo; the Inns of London, as related by Jack
Bamber&mdash;see &ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; chapter 21&mdash;also
containing a description of the advertisements of the tavern, as
then displayed therein.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the lower windows, which were decorated
with curtains of a saffron hue, dangled two or three printed
cards, bearing reference to Devonshire cyder and Dantzic spruce,
while a large black board, announcing in white letters to an
enlightened public, that there were 500,000 barrels of double
stout in the cellars of the establishment, left the mind in a
state of not unpleasing doubt and uncertainty as to the precise
direction in the bowels of the earth, in which this mighty cavern
might be supposed to extend.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Dick Swiveller</i> would doubtless occasionally patronise
this establishment.&nbsp; He lodged hereabouts &ldquo;in the
neighbourhood of Drury Lane;&rdquo; but it is difficult to
indicate any particular house which Dickens may have selected for
his accommodation.</p>
<p>Stretching eastward from this point is <i>Portugal Street</i>,
famed in the same book as containing the <b>Old Public House</b>
patronised by Mr. Tony Weller and his <i>confr&egrave;res</i> of
the coach-driving persuasion.&nbsp; This house&mdash;opposite the
Insolvent Debtors&rsquo; Court&mdash;existed until a few years
since, by name, &ldquo;The Horse and Groom.&rdquo;&nbsp; It and
many more besides, have now given place to a range of new offices
and buildings in Elizabethan style, on the south side of the
street (forming the north boundary of New Court), and the
Insolvent Court has been recently appropriated to the uses of the
Bankruptcy Court.&nbsp; It will be remembered that it was here
<i>Mr. Samuel Weller</i> got into difficulties, and was hence
consigned to the Fleet Prison at the instance of his father; the
professional services of the suave <i>Mr. Solomon Pell</i> being
retained on that occasion.&nbsp; Here also a select committee of
friends assembled to assist at an oyster lunch and the proving of
<a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Mrs.
Weller&rsquo;s will, when Mr. Pell again conducted the business
to the satisfaction of all concerned.&mdash;See
&ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; chapters 43 and 55.</p>
<p>Returning through Portsmouth Street, we come into
<i>Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields</i>; and, keeping on its western
side&mdash;passing Sardinia Street, with its old archway, on the
left&mdash;we may note <b>Mr. John Forster&rsquo;s House</b>,
<b>No. 58</b>.&nbsp; At this house resided the friend and
biographer of Dickens, and here our author was, of course, a
frequent visitor.&nbsp; On December the 2nd, 1844, Charles
Dickens here first read his new Christmas book, &ldquo;The
Chimes,&rdquo; to a select and critical audience, including
Messrs. Forster, Maclise, Douglas Jerrold, Carlyle, Laman
Blanchard, Fox, Stanfield, Harness, and Dyce.&nbsp; The house is
itself described in the pages of &ldquo;Bleak House&rdquo;
(chapter 10) as the</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Residence of Mr. Tulkinghorn</span>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In a large house, formerly a house of
state, lives Mr. Tulkinghorn.&nbsp; It is let off in sets of
chambers now; and in those shrunken fragments of its greatness,
lawyers lie, like maggots in nuts.&nbsp; But its roomy
staircases, passages, and antechambers still remain; and even its
painted ceiling, where Allegory in Roman helmet and celestial
linen sprawls among balustrades and pillars, flowers, clouds, and
big-legged boys, and makes the head ache, as would seem to be
Allegory&rsquo;s object always, more or less.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As in the time spoken of, the house is still in legal
possession, being let out as solicitors&rsquo; offices; but the
old Allegory has disappeared beneath modern whitewash.&nbsp;
Within two minutes&rsquo; distance northward, the weary rambler
may reach the central thoroughfare of <span
class="smcap">Holborn</span>, where (turning to the left), close
at hand, will be found the <i>Holborn Restaurant</i>, at which
Sam Weller&rsquo;s advice on the subject of a &ldquo;little
dinner&rdquo; (or luncheon) may be worth practical
consideration:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Pair of fowls and a weal cutlet; French
beans, &rsquo;taturs, tart, and tidiness.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Certain it is that everything at this establishment will be
found &ldquo;werry clean and comfortable,&rdquo; on reasonable
terms.</p>

class="smcap">Jarndyce</span>, dragged &ldquo;its slow length
along&rdquo; through the weary years, involving</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Bills, cross-bills, answers, rejoinders,
injunctions, affidavits, issues, references to masters,
masters&rsquo; reports&mdash;mountains of costly
nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, on a seat at the side of the hall, stood little <i>Miss
Flite</i>, in her squeezed bonnet, carrying &ldquo;her
documents,&rdquo; and</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Always expecting some incomprehensible
judgment in her favour.&rdquo;&mdash;See &ldquo;Bleak
House,&rdquo; chapter 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The business of Chancery procedure is now transferred to the
New Law Courts.&nbsp; Hard by, on the north, passing through the
cloisters of the Chapel of Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, we come into the
enclosure of <b>Old Square</b>, <span
class="smcap">Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn</span>, where the <i>Offices of
Messrs. Kenge and Carboy</i> were situated.&nbsp; Esther
Summerson says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We passed into sudden quietude, under an
old gateway, and drove on through a silent square, until we came
to an odd nook in a corner, where there was an entrance up a
steep broad flight of stairs, like an entrance to a
church.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The houses in this square have been all rebuilt; but Kenge and
Co.&rsquo;s offices used to flourish in the north-west corner,
where still the rising of the ground necessitates an exterior
flight of steps.&nbsp; The chambers of <i>Sergeant Snubbin</i>,
counsel for the defence in &ldquo;Bardell <i>v.</i>
Pickwick,&rdquo; were also located in this square, probably on
the opposite side.</p>
<p>Returning to Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, we may follow Esther
Summerson&rsquo;s directions, and visit the apartments of <i>Miss
Flite</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Slipping us out of a little side gate, the
old lady stopped most unexpectedly in a narrow back street, part
of some courts and lanes immediately outside the wall of the inn,
and said, &lsquo;This is my lodging.&nbsp; Pray walk
up!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Thus,
passing at the back of the Inn, and taking the next turning on
the left, we arrive at <b>Bishop&rsquo;s Court</b>, near at hand,
a narrow, dark, and old passage leading to Chancery Lane.&nbsp;
On the left hand, nearest the Inn, was <i>Krook&rsquo;s Rag and
Bottle Warehouse</i>, probably No. 3.&nbsp; But during recent
years, all the old houses of the court have been substituted by
modern buildings, offices, and shops; so that the location only
remains of the &ldquo;Lord Chancellor,&rdquo; and his place of
business, yclept by the neighbours the &ldquo;Court of
Chancery.&rdquo;&nbsp; The old shop, at one time, possessed the
private door and stairway leading to <i>Miss Flite&rsquo;s
lodging</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;She lived at the top of the house, in a
pretty large room, from which she had a glimpse of the roof of
Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Hall.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, too, Captain Hawdon, otherwise <i>Nemo</i>, the
law-writer, lived and died in a bare room on the second
floor.&nbsp; A notice may have been observed in the old shop
window, &ldquo;Engrossing and Copying.&rdquo;&nbsp; It will be
remembered that this room was afterwards occupied by <i>Mr. Tony
Weevle</i>, during whose tenancy it was decorated with a choice
collection of magnificent portraits, being&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Copper-plate impressions from that truly
national work, the Divinities of Albion, or Galaxy Gallery of
British Beauty; representing ladies of title and fashion, in
every variety of smirk, that art, combined with capital, is
capable of producing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Returning to the top of the court, and passing a short
distance along Star Yard, we reach, at the corner of
<i>Chichester Rents</i>, a modern warehouse (No. 7), recently
erected on the site of &ldquo;<b>The Old Ship Tavern</b>,&rdquo;
now <i>non est</i>, named in the pages of &ldquo;Bleak
House&rdquo; <i>The Sol&rsquo;s Arms</i>, it being the house at
which <i>the Inquest was held</i>, following the death of
<i>Nemo</i>, as described in chapter 11; on which occasion the
proffered evidence of Poor Jo was virtuously rejected by the
presiding coroner.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t exactly say; won&rsquo;t do,
you know.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t take that in a Court of Justice,
gentlemen.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s terrible depravity.&nbsp; Put the boy
aside.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>The old
tavern has given place to the exigencies of modern commerce
(1897).&nbsp; The ghost of <i>Little Swills</i> may still linger
in the neighbourhood, but the musical evenings of the past are
silent, being now superseded by the prosaics of ordinary
business.</p>
<p>The real <span class="smcap">Sol&rsquo;s Arms</span> still
exists, <i>No.</i> 65 <i>Hampstead Road</i>, <i>N.W.</i>, at the
corner of Charles Street, once known as Sol&rsquo;s Row.&nbsp;
Its name was derived from the &ldquo;Sol&rsquo;s Society,&rdquo;
whose meetings, held therein, were of a Masonic character.&nbsp;
It has been suggested that Dickens transferred the style and name
of this house to the neighbourhood of Chancery Lane, as
above.</p>
<p>Coming now into Chancery Lane, we may observe, nearly opposite
the old gateway of Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, <b>Cursitor Street</b>, a
thoroughfare leading eastward from the Lane.&nbsp; It will be
noticed that the houses in this street are comparatively of
recent erection, and we may now look in vain for <span
class="smcap">Coavinses&rsquo; Castle</span>, which has been
swept away by the besom of modern destruction and
improvement.&nbsp; This old sponging-house flourished (in the
days of Harold Skimpole) on the left of the street, on the site
now occupied by <i>Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Chambers</i>, No. 1.</p>
<p>At a short distance in Cursitor Street (No. 9) we come to a
turning on the left to <i>Took&rsquo;s Court</i>, referred to in
&ldquo;Bleak House&rdquo; as <i>Cook&rsquo;s Court</i>, in which
was <b>Mr. Snagsby&rsquo;s Residence</b> <span class="smcap">and
Law Stationer&rsquo;s Shop</span>.&nbsp; The court is not a long
one, and consists mainly of offices connected with the legal
profession.&nbsp; The location of Mr. Snagsby&rsquo;s shop was at
the central corner on the left, the site being now occupied by
modern offices and stores.&nbsp; &ldquo;The little drawing-room
upstairs&rdquo; is described as commanding</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A view of Cook&rsquo;s Court at one end
(not to mention a squint into Cursitor Street) and of
Coavins&rsquo;s, the Sheriff&rsquo;s Officer&rsquo;s, backyard on
the other.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The memorable, but now non-existent room, as prepared <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>for the
reception of the <i>Rev. Mr. Chadband</i> (Chaplain-in-Ordinary
to Mrs. Snagsby), who was &ldquo;endowed with the gift of holding
forth for four hours at a stretch.&rdquo;&nbsp; On that occasion,
it will be remembered that Poor Jo&mdash;brought to Cook&rsquo;s
Court by a police constable&mdash;was eloquently addressed by the
reverend gentleman, but was not greatly edified by his
admonitions.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At this threatening stage of the discourse,
Jo, who seems to have been gradually going out of his mind,
smears his right arm over his face, and gives a terrible
yawn.&nbsp; Mrs. Snagsby indignantly expresses her belief that he
is a limb of the arch-fiend.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Returning by Chancery Lane, on the left hand, we may note
<i>Bream&rsquo;s Buildings</i>, as being the northern boundary of
the former site of <b>Symond&rsquo;s Inn</b>, which hence
extended onward to No. 22.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A little, pale, wall-eyed, woebegone inn,
like a large dust-bin of two compartments and a sifter.&nbsp; It
looks as if Symond were a sparing man in his day, and constructed
his inn of old building materials, which took kindly to the dry
rot, and to dirt, and all things decaying and dismal, and
perpetuated Symond&rsquo;s memory with congenial
shabbiness.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This inn has ceased to exist for many years past, its position
being now occupied by a large printer&rsquo;s establishment and
other offices.&nbsp; Readers of &ldquo;Bleak House&rdquo; will
remember that the professional chambers of <i>Mr. Vholes</i> were
here situated, and that <i>Richard Carstone</i> and his young
wife <i>Ada</i> resided in the next house, in order that Richard
might have his legal adviser close at hand.&nbsp; Here occurred
the early death of poor Richard; and we all cherish the
remembrance of dear Ada&rsquo;s wifely devotion, to which
<i>Esther Summerson</i> thus refers:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The days when I frequented that miserable
corner which my dear girl brightened can never fade in my
remembrance.&nbsp; I never see it, and I never wish to see it
now; I have been there only once since; but in my memory there is
a mournful glory shining on the place, which will shine for
ever.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leaving Chancery Lane, and turning (right) by Carey Street, we
reach <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span><b>Bell Yard</b>, leading to Fleet Street.&nbsp; This
place has been mentioned by Dickens as containing a
&ldquo;chandler&rsquo;s shop, left-hand side,&rdquo; where lodged
<i>Gridley</i>, &ldquo;the man from Shropshire,&rdquo; and
<i>Neckett</i>, the faithful servitor of Coavinses.&nbsp; The
name&mdash;Bell Yard&mdash;forms the heading of chapter 15,
&ldquo;Bleak House,&rdquo; which affords information of the
Neckett family&mdash;<i>Charlie</i>, <i>Tom</i>, and the
limp-bonneted <i>baby</i>.&nbsp; For full details, reference
should be made to this very touching and beautifully-written
chapter as above.&nbsp; Great alterations have been made, and are
still being made, in this narrow lane, since the erection of the
New Law Courts in the immediate vicinity; but some of the older
houses still remain on the left-hand side of the way.&nbsp; Of
these, No. 9 is a small, tall, squeezed-looking house, about
half-way down the alley, and may be safely assigned (thirty years
since) to the tenancy of the good-natured Mrs. Blinder.</p>
<p>Passing through Bell Yard, we reach <i>Fleet Street</i>, at
the point where once <span class="smcap">Temple Bar</span> gave
ancient entrance to the City.&nbsp; Its position is marked by a
bronze griffin, surmounting a memorial pedestal beneath.&nbsp;
Exactly on the opposite side of the street is the handsome modern
erection of <i>Child&rsquo;s Bank</i>.&nbsp; This new building
dates from 1878, when the structure of old <i>Temple Bar</i> was
removed.&nbsp; It replaces one of the very old-fashioned houses
of London, in which for many years Messrs. Child carried on their
important banking business.&nbsp; This house is spoken of by
Dickens, in his &ldquo;Tale of Two Cities,&rdquo; as
<b>Tellson&rsquo;s Bank</b>, on the outside of which the
mysterious <i>Mr. Cruncher</i> was usually in attendance as
&ldquo;odd-job man, and occasional porter and
messenger.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Tellson&rsquo;s Bank, by Temple Bar, was an
old-fashioned place even in the year 1780.&nbsp; It was very
small, very dark, very ugly, very incommodious.&nbsp; Any one of
the partners would have disinherited his son on the question of
rebuilding Tellson&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Thus it had come to pass that
Tellson&rsquo;s was the triumphant perfection of
inconvenience.&nbsp; After bursting open a door of idiotic
obstinacy with a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into
Tellson&rsquo;s, down two steps, and came to your senses in a
miserable little shop, with two little counters; where the oldest
of men made your cheque shake as if the wind rustled it, while <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>they examined
the signature by the dingiest of windows, which were always under
a shower-bath of mud from Fleet Street, and which were made the
dingier by their own iron bars proper and the shadow of Temple
Bar.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>Passing Newton&rsquo;s (optician) we arrive at the outer
<b>Gate of the Temple</b>, by which we enter <i>Middle Temple
Lane</i>, following which a short distance and turning to the
right, by <i>Middle Temple Hall</i>, we reach <b>Fountain
Court</b>.&nbsp; The fountain standing here, conspicuously in a
central position, is associated with the history of <i>Ruth
Pinch</i>.&nbsp; Here it was that Tom and his sister made
appointments for meeting&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Because, of course, when she had to wait a
minute or two, it would have been very awkward for her to have
had to wait in any but a quiet spot; and that was as quiet a
spot, everything considered, as they could choose.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On further reference to the pages of &ldquo;Martin
Chuzzlewit,&rdquo; we may recall the auspicious occasion when
Ruth was under the special escort of <i>John
Westlock</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Brilliantly the Temple fountain sparkled in
the sun, and merrily the idle drops of water danced and danced;
and, peeping out in sport among the trees, plunged lightly down
to hide themselves, as little Ruth and her companion came towards
it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See chapter 53.&nbsp; In <b>Garden Court</b> beyond, <i>Mr.
Pip</i> and his friend, <i>Herbert Pocket</i>, had
residence.&nbsp; In &ldquo;Great Expectations,&rdquo; he
says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Our Chambers were in Garden Court, down by
the river.&nbsp; We lived at the top of the last
house.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Pip&rsquo;s patron and benefactor, the convict
<i>Magwitch</i>, <i>alias Provis</i>, disclosed himself one
memorable night, much to his &ldquo;dear boy&rsquo;s&rdquo;
discomfiture; and it will be remembered that temporary
accommodation was found for him at</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A lodging-house in Essex Street, the back
of which looked into the Temple, and was almost within hail of
&lsquo;Pip&rsquo;s&rsquo; windows.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The houses in this court have been rebuilt, and we may <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>look in vain
for the actual chambers specified.&nbsp; Returning to <i>Middle
Temple Lane</i>, the visitor may walk directly across it to
<i>Elm Court</i>, and proceed through the same and a narrow
passage beyond, turning to the left, through <i>The
Cloisters</i>, which (left again) give into the central location
of <b>Pump Court</b>, an oblong old-fashioned court of offices,
four storeys high.&nbsp; Here, in all probability, were situated
<span class="smcap">The Chambers</span> where <i>Tom Pinch</i>
was mysteriously installed as librarian to an unknown employer,
by the eccentric <i>Mr. Fips</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He led the way through sundry lanes and
courts, into one more quiet and gloomy than the rest; and,
singling out a certain house, ascended a common staircase . . .
stopping before a door upon an upper storey. . . .&nbsp; There
were two rooms on that floor; and in the first, or outer one, a
narrow staircase leading to two more above.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, also, old <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i> revealed himself to
the astonished Tom in his true character, and surprised the
virtuous <i>Mr. Pecksniff</i> by a &ldquo;warm reception,&rdquo;
when &ldquo;the tables were turned completely upside
down.&rdquo;&mdash;See &ldquo;Chuzzlewit,&rdquo; chapters 39 and
52.</p>
<p>Proceeding past <i>Lamb Buildings</i>, on the east side of the
Cloisters, and by a passage six steps downwards, leading beneath
the <i>Inner Temple Dining-Hall</i>, we may note across the road
(right) a short range of substantial houses, known as <b>Paper
Buildings</b>, facing <i>King&rsquo;s Bench Walk</i>, where it
will be remembered that <i>Sir John Chester</i> had his
residential chambers, no doubt selecting a central
position&mdash;say, at No. 3.&nbsp; Here at various times Mr.
Edward Chester, Hugh, Sim Tappertit, and Gabriel Varden had
audience with Sir John; for full particulars of which
&ldquo;overhaul the wollume&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Barnaby
Rudge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this neighbourhood also were situated the chambers of
<i>Mr. Stryver</i>, <i>K.C.</i>, where <i>Sydney Carton</i>
served as &ldquo;jackal&rdquo; to that &ldquo;fellow of
delicacy;&rdquo; as we read in &ldquo;The Tale of Two
Cities,&rdquo; how Sydney</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Having revived himself by twice pacing the
pavements of King&rsquo;s Bench Walk and Paper Buildings, turned
into the Stryver Chambers.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>Returning to Fleet Street by Lamb Buildings, and passing
in front of the Old Temple Church, we come to Goldsmith&rsquo;s
Buildings (right), which overlook the old burial-ground and the
tomb of the doctor.&nbsp; This surely is the &ldquo;dismal
churchyard&rdquo; referred to in &ldquo;Our Mutual Friend&rdquo;
as being closely contiguous to the offices of Messrs. Lightwood
and Wrayburn.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whosoever . . . had looked up at the dismal
windows commanding that churchyard, until at the most dismal
window of them all, he saw a dismal boy, would in him have beheld
. . . the clerk of Mr. Mortimer Lightwood.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;Note the last window on the left (second
floor), nearest the west wing, lately rebuilt.</p>
<p>Coming again into Fleet Street, by the arched gateway of Inner
Temple Lane, the wayfarer may recall the circumstance of
<b>Bradley Headstone&rsquo;s</b> nightly watchings opposite this
point for the outgoings of <i>Mr. Eugene Wrayburn</i>, and the
many fruitless journeys which were hence commenced, as Eugene
enjoyed &ldquo;the pleasures of the chase&rdquo; at the expense
of his unfortunate rival.</p>
<p>Nearly facing us, on the north side of Fleet Street, is
<b>Clifford&rsquo;s Inn Passage</b>, into whose retirement <i>Mr.
Rokesmith</i>, the hero of &ldquo;Our Mutual Friend,&rdquo;
withdrew from the noise of Fleet Street, with <i>Mr. Boffin</i>,
when offering that gentleman his services as secretary.</p>
<p>Close at hand stands <b>St. Dunstan&rsquo;s Church</b>, near
to which the pump was, but is not, from whose refreshing streams
&ldquo;<i>Hugh</i>&rdquo; (from the Maypole, Chigwell) sobered
himself by a drenching on one occasion previous to visiting Sir
John Chester at Paper Buildings.&nbsp; (<i>Vide</i>
&ldquo;Barnaby Rudge,&rdquo; chapter 40.)&nbsp; The old pump has
been replaced by a drinking-fountain.</p>
<p><i>Toby Veck</i> surely must have known that pump; for though
there is no precise location given by Dickens in &ldquo;The
Chimes&rdquo; for the church near to which Toby waited for jobs,
there is an etching by Stanfield in the original <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>edition of
that book (page 88), which is unmistakably the counterfeit
presentment of St. Dunstan&rsquo;s Tower.</p>
<p>Continuing the route, we pass <i>Bouverie Street</i> (Bradbury
and Evans&mdash;now Bradbury, Agnew, and Co.&mdash;in this street
were the publishers of several of the works of Dickens,
&ldquo;The Chimes&rdquo; included) on the right, next arriving at
<i>Whitefriars&rsquo; Street</i> on the same side.</p>
<p>At the corner of the street, No. 67, is the public <b>Office
of</b> &ldquo;<b>The Daily News</b>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
influential newspaper was started January 21, 1846, under the
supervision of Charles Dickens, and in the earlier numbers of the
journal were published instalments of his &ldquo;Pictures from
Italy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dickens shortly relinquished the editorship,
being succeeded by his friends Jerrold and Forster.&nbsp; The
fact is, Charles never greatly cared for the study of general or
party politics; but he always identified himself with &ldquo;the
People&mdash;spelt with a large P, who are governed,&rdquo;
rather than &ldquo;the people&mdash;spelt with a small p, who
govern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A short distance down Whitefriars&rsquo; Street is a passage
(left) from which, at a right angle riverwards, we may look into
<b>Hanging Sword Alley</b>, where Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher,
messenger at Tellson&rsquo;s, had his two apartments.&nbsp; These
&ldquo;were very decently kept&rdquo; by his wife, whose
&ldquo;flopping&rdquo; proclivities gave so much umbrage to
Jerry.</p>
<p>On the opposite side of Fleet Street&mdash;No. 146&mdash;just
beyond, we turn (left) into <i>Wine Office Court</i>, and, on the
right, we arrive at &ldquo;<b>Ye Olde Cheshire
Cheese</b>.&rdquo;&nbsp; In &ldquo;The Tale of Two Cities,&rdquo;
Book 2, chapter 4, we read that <i>Charles Darnay</i>, being
acquitted of the charge of high treason, on his trial at the Old
Bailey, was persuaded by the young lawyer, <i>Sydney Carton</i>,
to dine in his company thereafter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Drawing his arm through his own, he took
him down Ludgate Hill to Fleet Street, and so up a covered way
into a tavern.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, of course, was the tavern intended; it having been a
noted resort with literary and legal men for more than a <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>century
past.&nbsp; Here Doctor Johnson and Oliver Goldsmith frequently
dined together in days gone by, gravely discoursing over their
punch afterwards; and, in more recent years, Thackeray, Dickens,
Jerrold, Sala, and others have been reckoned among the customary
guests of the establishment.&nbsp; Mr. George Augustus Sala, in a
pleasant description of the place, writes as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Let it be noted in candour that Law finds
its way to the &lsquo;Cheese&rsquo; as well as Literature; but
the Law is, as a rule, of the non-combatant, and, consequently,
harmless order.&nbsp; Literary men who have been called to the
Bar, but do not practise; briefless young barristers, who do not
object to mingling with newspaper men; with a sprinkling of
retired solicitors (amazing dogs these for old port wine; the
landlord has some of the same bin which served as Hippocrene to
Judge Blackstone when he wrote his
&lsquo;Commentaries&rsquo;)&mdash;these make up the legal element
of the &lsquo;Cheese.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The journey being resumed through Fleet Street, the visitor
attains <i>Ludgate Circus</i>, from which <i>Farringdon
Street</i> leads northward on the left.&nbsp; A short detour
along this thoroughfare, facing the handsome bridge of the
Holborn Viaduct, will afford a sight of <i>Farringdon Market</i>
on the left side.&nbsp; Its position will recall the description
given in &ldquo;Barnaby Rudge,&rdquo; in whose days it was known
as <b>Fleet Market</b>,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At that time a long irregular row of wooden
sheds and penthouses occupying the centre of what is now called
Farringdon Street. . . .&nbsp; It was indispensable to most
public conveniences in those days that they should be public
nuisances likewise, and Fleet Market maintained the principle to
admiration.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the rioters assembled&mdash;as narrated in the book
before mentioned&mdash;and passed a merry night in the midst of
congenial surroundings.&nbsp; Retracing our steps, we may note,
on the east side of Farringdon Street, the site of the old
<b>Fleet Prison</b>, on a part of which now stands the <span
class="smcap">Congregational Memorial Hall</span>.&nbsp; The
prison&mdash;fifty years since&mdash;stretched eastward in the
rear as far as the present premises of Messrs. Cassell and Co.,
Belle Sauvage Yard.&nbsp; <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>Its last remaining walls were removed
in 1872, when the foundation-stone of the &ldquo;Memorial
Hall&rdquo; aforesaid was laid.&nbsp; Here was imprisoned our
amiable friend <i>Mr. Pickwick</i>, attended by his faithful Sam,
until the time when the costs of Messrs. Dodson and Fogg in
<i>re</i> Bardell <i>versus</i> Pickwick were by him fully paid
and satisfied.</p>
<p>Proceeding up <i>Ludgate Hill</i>, we may soon note the
<b>Belle Sauvage Yard</b> (turning by No. 68, on the left).&nbsp;
The old inn, with its central metropolitan coach-yard, sixty
years since occupied this site, where now the extensive printing
and publishing offices of Cassell and Co. hold benignant
sway.&nbsp; The place is referred to in an anecdote of <i>Sam
Weller&rsquo;s</i> anent the preparation of his father&rsquo;s
marriage licence, as arranged at Doctors&rsquo; Commons, the
place being evidently regarded by that respected coachman as his
parochial headquarters in London&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is your name, sir?&rsquo; says
the lawyer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tony Weller,&rsquo; says my
father.&nbsp; &lsquo;Parish?&rsquo; says the lawyer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Belle Savage,&rsquo; says my father; for he stopped there
when he drove up, and he know&rsquo;d nothing about parishes,
<i>he</i> didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The plan of the inn-yard is considerably changed from its
olden style.&nbsp; In Mr. Weller&rsquo;s time it comprised two
courts, the outer one being approached from Ludgate Hill by the
present entrance, and the Belle Sauvage Inn forming a second
quadrangle, with an archway about half-way up from the main
entrance.&nbsp; In this interior court was the coach-yard,
surrounded by covered wooden galleries, in accordance with the
fashion of the times.</p>
<p>Passing onwards on the same side, past <i>Old Bailey</i>, we
arrive at the site of the <b>London Coffee Tavern</b>, No. 46
Ludgate Hill, now occupied by the corner shop of Messrs. Hope
Brothers, the well-known outfitters.&nbsp; The old house was
pulled down in 1872.&nbsp; Here <i>Mr. Arthur Clennam</i> rested
awhile on his arrival &ldquo;from Marseilles by way of Dover, and
by Dover coach, &lsquo;the Blue-Eyed Maid,&rsquo;&rdquo; one
dismal Sunday evening, as narrated in chapter 3 of &ldquo;Little
Dorrit.&rdquo;&nbsp; We now soon come to <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span><b>St.
Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard</b>, facing the dial by which <i>Ralph
Nickleby</i> corrected his watch on his way to the London Tavern,
no doubt &ldquo;stepping aside&rdquo; into No.
1&mdash;Dakin&rsquo;s&mdash;&ldquo;doorway&rdquo; to do it; and
we may probably be disposed to endorse <i>John
Browdie&rsquo;s</i> verdict with reference to St. Paul&rsquo;s
Cathedral itself.&nbsp; &ldquo;See there, lass, there be
Paul&rsquo;s Church.&nbsp; Ecod, he be a soizable one, he
be.&rdquo;&nbsp; This locality is also mentioned in
&ldquo;Barnaby Rudge&rdquo; as being in the line of road taken by
<i>Lord George Gordon</i> when entering London with his friends
<i>en route</i> for his residence in Welbeck Street.&nbsp; On the
right, within a short distance, we come to <b>Dean&rsquo;s
Court</b>, formerly <span class="smcap">Doctors&rsquo;
Commons</span>. This place is referred to by <i>Sam Weller</i> as
being in</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard&mdash;low
archway on the carriage side, bookseller&rsquo;s at one corner,
hot-el on the other, and two porters in the middle, as touts for
licences.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He further relates to Mr. Pickwick the circumstance of his
father&rsquo;s having been here persuaded to take a marriage
licence, directing the lady&rsquo;s name to be filled in on
speculation.</p>
<p>We hear more of Doctors&rsquo; Commons in the chronicles of
&ldquo;David Copperfield.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>The Offices of Spenlow and Jorkins</b> were situated in
this locality; but the site is now occupied by the Post Office
Savings&rsquo; Bank in <i>Knightrider Street</i>.&nbsp; Passing
through the Archway and by the Deanery of St. Paul&rsquo;s
(right), we cross <i>Carter Lane</i>, and proceed by a narrow
court, <i>Bell Yard</i>, to the street above mentioned.&nbsp; At
the corner of Carter Lane and Bell Yard is the &ldquo;<i>Bell
Tavern</i>,&rdquo; which it may be interesting to note, as a
house where Mr. Dickens frequently rested, making his notes in
preparation for David&rsquo;s &ldquo;choice of a
profession.&rdquo;&nbsp; For full particulars the Rambler is
referred to chapter 23 of David&rsquo;s autobiography.</p>
<p>It may also be remembered that the worthy <i>Mr. Boffin</i>
(see &ldquo;Our Mutual Friend&rdquo;), when instructing his
attorney, seemed to be somewhat mixed in his ideas relative to
this institution.&nbsp; In conversation with Mr. Lightwood, he
once <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>referred to the same as a legal
personality&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Doctor Scommons</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This locality has, of late years, altogether changed both its
name and aspect.&nbsp; The old archway has disappeared.&nbsp; As
previously stated, it is now known as Dean&rsquo;s Court.&nbsp;
In connection with its old associations, there exists <i>The
Bishop of London&rsquo;s Registry and Marriage Licence
Office</i>, at the east corner of the court; and there are some
Proctors&rsquo; offices doing business, as in the days of
Copperfield, in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>On the east side of the Cathedral, the visitor turns into
Cheapside, soon arriving, on the left-hand side of the way (No.
122), at <b>Wood Street</b>.&nbsp; Associated with &ldquo;Great
Expectations,&rdquo; as containing &ldquo;Cross Keys Inn&rdquo;
(&ldquo;<i>The Castle</i>,&rdquo; No. 25), at which house Mr. Pip
arrived when first visiting London, in accordance with
instructions received per <i>Mr. Jaggers</i>.</p>
<p>Crossing Cheapside, and onwards by the south side, we reach
the well-known establishment of the <b>London Stereoscopic
Company</b>, No. 54.&nbsp; It may be interesting to know that
this firm possesses the stuffed original of
&ldquo;<i>Grip</i>,&rdquo; the Raven, the fortunate bird that
received a double passport to fame, Dickens having narrated the
particulars of its decease, and Maclise having sketched its
apotheosis.&nbsp; This relic, so intimately associated with the
tale of &ldquo;Barnaby Rudge,&rdquo; was purchased at the public
sale of Mr. Dickens&rsquo;s effects for &pound;110, and its
photographic portrait may be now obtained at this address.</p>
<p>A few steps farther on the same side stands the old <b>Church
of St. Mary-le-Bow</b>, whose bells recalled Dick Whittington to
fame and fortune.&nbsp; These same bells are mentioned in the
history of &ldquo;Dombey and Son,&rdquo; chapter 4, as being
within hearing at the offices of that important firm.</p>
<p>Passing on, and crossing to the north side of the
thoroughfare, we arrive at King Street (turning by No. 92), at
the top of which is <b>The Guildhall</b>.&nbsp; In the City Court
attached thereto, that memorable case for breach of promise of
marriage, <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>&ldquo;Bardell <i>v.</i> Pickwick,&rdquo; was contested,
on which occasion <i>Mr. Weller</i>, <i>senr.</i>, emphatically
insisted (from the body of the Court) on Sam&rsquo;s spelling his
name with a &ldquo;we,&rdquo; and afterwards much deplored the
absence of certain technical defence on Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
behalf&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, Sammy, Sammy, vy vorn&rsquo;t there a
alleybi?&rdquo;&nbsp; Are not all these and other particulars
written in the chronicles of the &ldquo;Pickwick
Papers&rdquo;?&mdash;See chapter 34.</p>
<p>Resuming the promenade of Cheapside (still in the reverse
direction of the progress of Lord George Gordon and his escort),
we come into the <b>Poultry</b>, at the farther end, passing a
turning on the left therefrom, known as <span
class="smcap">Grocers&rsquo; Hall Court</span>.&nbsp; It will be
remembered that on one occasion when Mr. Pickwick desired a quiet
glass of brandy and water, Sam Weller, whose &ldquo;knowledge of
London was extensive and peculiar,&rdquo; led the way from the
Mansion House, proceeding by the second court on the right, to
the last house but one on the same side of the way, where he
directed his master to</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Take the box as stands in the first
fireplace, &rsquo;cos there a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t no leg in the
middle of the table.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In pursuance of these explicit instructions, we shall find
that this house is now in possession of Mr. Sheppard, gasfitter,
but it is recollected that it was, aforetime, a restaurant of the
old-fashioned sort.&nbsp; Mr. Weller, the elder, was here
introduced to his son&rsquo;s patron, and thereupon arranged for
Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s journey to Ipswich.&nbsp; At the end of the
Poultry we next approach, on the right, <b>The Mansion House</b>,
mentioned in &ldquo;Barnaby Rudge&rdquo; as the residence of the
Mayor of London.&nbsp; We read of this civic potentate in the
pages of &ldquo;The Christmas Carol,&rdquo; when, one Christmas
Eve,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the
mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his fifty cooks and butlers
to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor&rsquo;s household
should.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Mark Tapley</i> also&mdash;in America&mdash;once made
jocose reference <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>to this location.&nbsp; When speaking of Queen Victoria,
he informed certain members of the Watertoast Association to the
following effect:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;She has lodgings, in virtue of her office,
with the Lord Mayor at the Mansion House, but don&rsquo;t often
occupy them, in consequence of the parlour chimney
smoking.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Messrs. Dombey and Son</b> had their offices in the City,
within the sound of Bow Bells, and not far from the Mansion
House.&nbsp; Their position was probably in proximity to <i>The
Royal Exchange</i>, but the address cannot be definitely
indicated.&nbsp; Here Mr. Carker, the manager, reigned supreme,
and schemed for his own aggrandisement, regardless of the
prosperity of the house.</p>
<p>The name of the firm is still perpetuated in the City, and the
thriving establishment of the well-known merchant
tailors&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dombey &amp;
Son</span>&mdash;will be found at No. 120 <i>Cheapside</i>, at
which a large and well-conducted business is carried on.</p>
<p>From this point we may conveniently visit &ldquo;His
Lordship&rsquo;s Larder&rdquo; (at three minutes&rsquo;
distance), Cheapside, where we may advantageously refresh,
&ldquo;rest, and be thankful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the <span class="smcap">South-Eastern Terminus</span> at
Charing Cross there are frequent trains by which the Rambler can
travel to <i>Spa Road Station</i>, <i>Bermondsey</i> (about
twenty minutes&rsquo; ride), from which point the situation of
what was once Jacob&rsquo;s Island may be conveniently
visited.&nbsp; This place was associated with the adventures of
<i>Oliver Twist</i>, being the last refuge to which <i>Sykes</i>,
the murderer of <i>Nancy</i>, betook himself on his return to
London, and where he met a righteous retribution when attempting
his escape.&nbsp; It is described by Dickens&mdash;nearly sixty
years since&mdash;as being</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Near to that part of the Thames on which
the church at Rotherhithe abuts, where the buildings on the banks
are dirtiest, and the vessels on the river blackest, with the
dust of colliers and the smoke of close-built, low-roofed
houses.&nbsp; In such a neighbourhood, beyond Dockhead, in the
borough of Southwark, stands Jacob&rsquo;s Island, <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>surrounded by
a muddy ditch, six or eight feet deep, and fifteen or twenty wide
when the tide is in, once called Mill Pond, but known in the days
of this story as Folly Ditch.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arriving at <i>Spa Road</i>, the explorer turns left and right
by the short routes of <i>West Street South</i>, <i>Fream
Street</i>, and <i>Rouel Road</i>, into <i>Jamaica Road</i> (five
minutes from station); passing from the opposite side of which,
through <i>Parker&rsquo;s Row</i> to the thoroughfare of
<i>Dockhead</i>, he will find himself face to face with a tavern
on the north side, named &ldquo;The Swan and Sugar
Loaf.&rdquo;&nbsp; A short cut on the right of this house leads
immediately to <span class="smcap">London Street</span>, its
northern side forming the south boundary of the old site of
<b>Jacob&rsquo;s Island</b>.&nbsp; <i>Folly Ditch</i>, flowing
from the Thames through Mill Street, took its course through
London Street (it has been filled in since 1851); and in these
streets wooden bridges crossed to the Island, and &ldquo;crazy
wooden galleries, common to the backs of half-a-dozen
houses&rdquo;&mdash;referred to by the novelist&mdash;used to
&ldquo;ornament the banks of Folly Ditch.&rdquo;&nbsp; To the
right we pass into <i>George Row</i>, enclosing Jacob&rsquo;s
Island (east), and may note <i>en passant</i> the blocks of
workmen&rsquo;s dwellings, erected 1883, named
&ldquo;Wolseley&rsquo;s Buildings,&rdquo; which occupy the site
of the old Island on its eastern side.&nbsp; From George Row we
turn (right) into <i>Jacob Street</i>, north of the Island, by
which we come into <i>Mill Street</i> (west); again returning to
<i>London Street</i>, and so completing the circumnavigation of
this interesting locality.&nbsp; Some of the old wooden erections
still exist in <i>Farthing Alley</i>, <i>Halfpenny Alley</i>, and
<i>Edward Street</i>, which intersect the area.&nbsp; In his
preface to the first cheap edition of &ldquo;Oliver Twist,&rdquo;
the author makes a further reference, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the year one thousand eight hundred and
fifty, it was publicly declared in London by an amazing alderman,
that Jacob&rsquo;s Island did not exist, and never had
existed.&nbsp; Jacob&rsquo;s Island continues to exist (like an
ill-bred place as it is) in the year one thousand eight hundred
and sixty-seven, though improved and much changed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Starting westward from &ldquo;The Swan and Sugar Loaf,&rdquo;
we now proceed through <i>Thornton Street</i>, and turn to the <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>right, by one
block in the street beyond, into <i>Queen Street</i>, which leads
directly north to the riverside.&nbsp; At the end of this street
is the locality of <b>Quilp&rsquo;s Wharf</b> and place of
business, aforetime described in the pages of &ldquo;The Old
Curiosity Shop&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A small, rat-infested, dreary yard, in
which were a little wooden counting-house, burrowing all awry in
the dust as if it had fallen from the clouds, and ploughed into
the ground; a few fragments of rusty anchors, several large iron
rings, some piles of rotten wood, and two or three heaps of old
sheet copper&mdash;crumpled, cracked, and battered.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The place has been altogether altered and improved during the
last forty years, and is now known as &ldquo;Butler&rsquo;s
Wharf,&rdquo; but the original prototype of Quilp is still
remembered by some of the older residents of the
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The westward route being continued by the side of the river,
we walk through <i>Shad Thames</i> and <i>Pickle Herring
Street</i> (underneath an archway) to <i>Vine Street</i>, where
is the southern entrance of the <i>Tower Subway</i>, by which we
may cross below the river to the other side.&nbsp; Emerging near
the Tower, <b>Quilp&rsquo;s House</b>, on Tower Hill, is near at
hand.&nbsp; No. 6 Tower Dock, facing the public entrance to the
Tower, is said to have comprised the lodging assigned by Dickens
for the accommodation of Mr. and Mrs. Daniel Quilp and Mrs.
Jiniwin.&nbsp; We may here recall the matrons&rsquo; tea-meeting,
as described in chapter 4 of &ldquo;The Old Curiosity
Shop,&rdquo; when Quilp&rsquo;s conduct as a husband was freely
discussed, and much good advice tendered to Mrs. Quilp for the
true assertion of her rights and dignity.&nbsp; Also the notable
occasion when, the master of the house being missing and thought
to be drowned, <i>Mr. Sampson Brass</i> was in consultation, and
the party were unpleasantly surprised, as they were preparing a
descriptive advertisement, by the sudden appearance of the Dwarf,
as lively and sarcastic as ever.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A question now arises with regard to his
nose.&nbsp; &lsquo;Flat,&rsquo; said Mrs. Jiniwin.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Aquiline!&rsquo; cried Quilp, thrusting in his head, and
striking <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>the feature with his fist.&nbsp; &lsquo;Aquiline, you
hag.&nbsp; Do you see it?&nbsp; Do you call this flat?&nbsp; Do
you?&nbsp; Eh?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hard by this locality stands <b>Trinity House</b>, <b>Tower
Hill</b>, with its garden in front, and it may be remembered that
<i>Mr. Wilfer</i> suggested this neighbourhood as a waiting-place
for Bella, on the occasion of their &ldquo;innocent
elopement&rdquo; to Greenwich, while he should array himself in
new garments at her expense, to do honour to the
expedition.&nbsp; We now turn westward by <i>Tower Street</i>,
and may save time by taking train at <i>Mark Lane Station</i> for
the Mansion House, about ten minutes&rsquo; ride.&nbsp; On
arrival at the Mansion House Station we shall find <i>Queen
Street</i> close at hand, leading riverwards to <b>Southwark
Bridge</b>, referred to in &ldquo;Little Dorrit&rdquo; as the
Iron Bridge.&nbsp; This was Amy Dorrit&rsquo;s favourite
promenade, it being quieter than many of the neighbouring
thoroughfares; and we may recall the scene when young <i>John
Chivery</i> was obliged to take no for an answer, when he
attempted the proffer of his hand and heart.</p>
<p>Proceeding onwards through <i>Cannon Street</i>, we turn to
the right through <i>St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard</i>, crossing
Cheapside to the stately edifice of the <b>General Post
Office</b>, <i>St. Martin&rsquo;s-le-Grand</i>.&nbsp; This
building, in the times of &ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby,&rdquo;
occasioned honest John Browdie some surprise:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Wa-at dost thee tak&rsquo; yon place to be,
noo, that &rsquo;un ower the wa&rsquo;?&nbsp; Ye&rsquo;d never
coom near it, gin ye thried for twolve moonths.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
na but a Poast-office.&nbsp; Ho, ho! they need to charge for
double latthers.&nbsp; A Poast-office!&nbsp; What dost thee think
of that?&nbsp; Ecod, if that&rsquo;s on&rsquo;y a Poast-office,
loike to see where the Lord Mayor o&rsquo; Lunnon
lives!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Aldersgate Street</i> leads northward from St.
Martin&rsquo;s-le-Grand; passing the first block in which,
<i>Falcon Street</i> turns on the right (No. 16) towards
<i>Falcon Square</i>, a small city piazza, where may be found
(No. 8) <b>The Falcon Hotel</b>.&nbsp; This is the place at which
John Jasper sojourned when visiting London.&nbsp; In &ldquo;The
Mystery of Edwin Drood&rdquo; we read the following commendation
of the house in question:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>&ldquo;It is hotel, boarding-house, or lodging-house at
its visitor&rsquo;s option.&nbsp; It announces itself, in the new
Railway advertisers, as a novel enterprise, timidly beginning to
spring up.&nbsp; It bashfully, almost apologetically, gives the
traveller to understand that it does not expect him, on the good
old constitutional hotel plan, to order a pint of sweet blacking
for his drinking, and throw it away; but insinuates that he may
have his boots blacked instead of his stomach, and may also have
bed, breakfast, attendance, and a porter up all night, for a
certain fixed charge.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Returning to Aldersgate Street, we shall find that the
opposite turning, leading to Smithfield, is <i>Little
Britain</i>.&nbsp; In &ldquo;Great Expectations&rdquo; we learn
that the <b>Offices of Mr. Jaggers</b>, the Old Bailey lawyer,
were here situated, in near proximity to Bartholomew Close; but
the house cannot be precisely indicated.&nbsp; Here <i>Mr.
Wemmick</i> assisted his Principal in the details of his
professional business.&nbsp; He may be remembered as having a
decided preference for &ldquo;portable property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Proceeding onward by <i>Duke Street</i>, the visitor will
shortly come into <b>Smithfield</b>, a locality which is
considerably changed since the days when Pip first arrived in
London.&nbsp; He says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When I told the clerk that I would take a
turn in the air while I waited, he advised me to go round the
corner and I should come into Smithfield.&nbsp; So I came into
Smithfield; and the shameful place, being all asmear with filth,
and fat, and blood, and foam, seemed to stick to me.&nbsp; So, I
rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a street
where I saw the great black dome of Saint Paul&rsquo;s bulging at
me from behind a grim stone building which a bystander said was
Newgate Prison.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adopting the same line of route, the Rambler may pass the
south front of the Metropolitan Meat Market, turning to the left
by St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s Hospital into <i>Giltspur Street</i>,
which leads to Newgate Street, and faces on the opposite corner
of Old Bailey <b>Newgate Prison</b>.&nbsp; In &ldquo;Great
Expectations,&rdquo; Pip describes his visit to the interior, at
the invitation and in the company of Mr. Wemmick:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>&ldquo;We passed through the Lodge, where some fetters
were hanging up, on the bare walls among the prison rules, into
the interior of the jail.&nbsp; At that time jails were much
neglected, and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on
all public wrong-doing&mdash;and which is always its longest and
heaviest punishment&mdash;was still far off.&nbsp; So, felons
were not lodged and fed better than soldiers (to say nothing of
paupers), and seldom set fire to their prisons with the excusable
object of improving the flavour of their soup.&nbsp; It was
visiting-time when Wemmick took me in, and a potman was going his
rounds with beer, and the prisoners behind bars in yards were
buying beer and talking to friends; and a frowsy, ugly,
disorderly, depressing scene it was.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, it may be remarked that things have much improved since
the good old days.&nbsp; <i>Inter alia</i>, the principles and
rules of prison management and discipline have greatly changed
for the better.</p>
<p>In the tale of &ldquo;Barnaby Rudge&rdquo; is the narrative of
the burning of Newgate and the liberation of the prisoners by the
rioters (1780), on which occasion it will be remembered that our
old friend Gabriel Varden was somewhat roughly handled.&nbsp; For
full particulars, see chapter 64.</p>
<p>Immediately south of Newgate is the adjacent Central Criminal
Court of <b>The Old Bailey</b>, the scene of Charles
Darnay&rsquo;s trial in &ldquo;The Tale of Two
Cities.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the time there described
(1775)&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Old Bailey was famous as a kind of
deadly Inn yard, from which pale travellers set out continually,
in carts and coaches, on a violent passage to the other world,
traversing some two miles and a half of public street and road,
and shaming few good citizens, if any.&nbsp; So powerful is use,
and so desirable to be good use in the beginning.&nbsp; It was
famous, too, for the pillory, a wise old institution, that
inflicted a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent;
also for the whipping-post, another dear old institution, very
humanising and softening to behold in action; also for extensive
transactions in blood-money, another fragment of ancestral
wisdom.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Facing eastward from Newgate Street is the <i>Holborn
Viaduct</i>, which has for many years superseded the old
ascending and descending road of Holborn Hill.</p>
<p><b>The Saracen&rsquo;s Head</b>, the old coaching-house on
Snow Hill, with which we have been familiar from the days of <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>&ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby,&rdquo; as the headquarters of
Mr. Squeers, has disappeared since 1868, having been pulled down
long ago, with many other buildings of this neighbourhood, giving
room to the great improvements which have taken place in this
part of London.&nbsp; Hereabouts it stood, on a lower level, not
far from St. Sepulchre&rsquo;s Church&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Just on that particular part of Snow Hill
where omnibus horses going eastward seriously think of falling
down on purpose, and horses in hackney cabriolets going westward
not unfrequently fall by accident.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The present <i>Police Station</i>, Snow Hill, stands on part
of the site formerly occupied by this old hostelry.</p>
<p>This modern thoroughfare of Snow Hill commences at the first
turning on the right, in which has been erected a commodious
hotel of the same name (No. 10), where, by the aid of a little
refreshment and a slight exercise of imagination, we may recall
the departure of Nicholas for Dotheboy&rsquo;s Hall, Greta
Bridge, by the Yorkshire coach, with Mr. Squeers and the pupils;
also the later arrival in London of Mr. and Mrs. Browdie,
accompanied by the lovely Fanny as bridesmaid, and the first
meeting of Nicholas with Frank Cheeryble, newly returned from
Continental travel.</p>
<p>Snow Hill leads to the lower level of <i>Farringdon Road</i>,
at a point immediately north of the Holborn Viaduct spanning the
thoroughfare, in which, turning to the right, we walk onwards to
the intersection of <i>Clerkenwell Road</i> (eight minutes&rsquo;
work).&nbsp; On the right hand, across the railway, is
<b>Clerkenwell Green</b>, referred to in &ldquo;Oliver
Twist&rdquo; as</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That open square in Clerkenwell which is
yet called by some strange perversion of terms The
Green.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was near this place that little Oliver became enlightened
as to the business of Charley Bates and the Artful Dodger.&nbsp;
We read that the boys, traversing a narrow court in this
neighbourhood, came out opposite a bookstall, where Mr. Brownlow
was reading, abstracted from all other mundane considerations, so
affording &ldquo;a prime plant&rdquo; for the <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>operations of
these light-fingered gentlemen.&nbsp; This court leads from the
road opposite the Sessions House into <i>Pear Tree Court</i>,
giving into the main road at some distance beyond, at which the
scene above referred to was enacted.</p>
<p>Walking onwards by the <i>King&rsquo;s Cross Road</i> we soon
come to the point where <i>Exmouth Street</i> joins it from the
east, facing the south-east angle of the House of
Correction.&nbsp; Here we strike into the route taken by Oliver
Twist when he first came from Barnet to London, under the escort
of <i>Mr. John Dawkins</i>.&nbsp; The text of the story is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They crossed from the &lsquo;Angel&rsquo;
into St. John&rsquo;s Road, struck down the small street which
terminates at Sadler&rsquo;s Wells Theatre, through Exmouth
Street and Coppice Row, down the little court by the side of the
Workhouse, across the classic ground which once bore the name of
Hockley-in-the-Hole, thence into Little Saffron Hill, and so into
Saffron Hill the Great.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following the line thus indicated from Exmouth Street, we come
on the south side of the Workhouse, nearly opposite Little
Saffron Hill, which leads into <i>Great Saffron Hill</i> as
above.&nbsp; Crossing <i>Clerkenwell Road</i>, and proceeding for
a short distance down Great Saffron Hill, we arrive at the cross
street of <i>Hatton Wall</i>, in which, past two doors to the
left on the south side, will be found&mdash;between the <i>Hat
and Tun Inn</i> and No. 17 beyond&mdash;the entrance of <span
class="smcap">Hatton Yard</span>, a long narrow lane or mews
(leading to <i>Kirby Street</i>), occupied by carmen and
stabling.&nbsp; In this eligible position was situated, some
fifty years since, &ldquo;the very notorious <b>Metropolitan
Police Court</b>&rdquo; to which Oliver Twist was taken on the
charge of theft; and we may here recall the administration of the
presiding magistrate, the notable Mr. Fang, as shown in the
examination of the prisoner.</p>
<p>The premises (No. 9, on the left) once formed part and parcel
of the police court referred to; but the arrangements of the
neighbourhood have been subjected to much alteration during the
last half century.&nbsp; Mr. Forster states that Dickens
&ldquo;had himself a satisfaction in admitting the <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>identity of
Mr. Fang, in &lsquo;Oliver Twist,&rsquo; with Mr. Laing of Hatton
Garden.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a letter (now in possession of Mr. S. R.
Goodman, of Brighton) written to Mr. Haines, Reporter, June 3rd,
1838, Dickens writes as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In my next number of &lsquo;Oliver
Twist&rsquo; I must have a magistrate; and, casting about for a
magistrate whose harshness and insolence would render him a fit
subject to be <i>shown up</i>, I have as a necessary consequence
stumbled upon Mr. Laing of Hatton Garden celebrity.&nbsp; I know
the man&rsquo;s character perfectly well; but as it would be
necessary to describe his personal appearance also, I ought to
have seen him, which (fortunately or unfortunately as the case
may be) I have never done.&nbsp; In this dilemma it occurred to
me that perhaps I might under your auspices be smuggled into the
Hatton Garden office for a few moments some morning.&nbsp; If you
can further my object I shall be really very greatly obliged to
you.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The opportunity was found; the magistrate was brought
up before the novelist; and shortly after, on some fresh outbreak
of intolerable temper, the Home Secretary found it an easy and
popular step to remove Mr. Laing from the Bench.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning to <span class="smcap">Great Saffron Hill</span>, we
may recall its description as given in the days of &ldquo;Oliver
Twist&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The street was very narrow and muddy, and
the air was impregnated with filthy odours.&nbsp; The sole places
that seemed to prosper amid the general blight of the place were
the public-houses, and in them the lowest orders of the Irish
were wrangling with might and main.&nbsp; Covered ways and yards,
which here and there diverged from the main street, disclosed
little knots of houses where drunken men and women were
positively wallowing in filth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Field Lane</b>, in the immediate vicinity, <i>was</i></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Near to that spot on which Snow Hill and
Holborn Hill meet . . a narrow dismal alley leading to Saffron
Hill.&nbsp; In its filthy shops are exposed for sale huge bunches
of second-hand silk handkerchiefs of all sizes and patterns, for
here reside the traders who purchase them from the
pickpockets.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This place has been effaced by the Holborn Valley
improvements, and we may now look in vain for the precise
locality of the house of <i>Fagin</i> the Jew.&nbsp; In this <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>neighbourhood
also was situated &ldquo;The Three Cripples,&rdquo; a
public-house of evil repute patronised by Sykes, Fagin, and
Monks.&nbsp; We may recall the circumstance of <i>Mr. Morris
Bolter&rsquo;s</i> (<i>alias</i> Noah Claypole&rsquo;s) arrival
at this house, when he and <i>Charlotte</i> first came to London,
and of his subsequent interview with the wily Jew.</p>
<p>It is pleasant to remark that Saffron Hill has greatly
improved in its character since the above-quoted description was
correct.&nbsp; It now affords accommodation for the headquarters
of the <i>Central Shoeblacks&rsquo; Society</i> (as established
under the auspices of the late Earl of Shaftesbury), and about
midway in the street where thieves &ldquo;did once
inhabit,&rdquo; a large <i>Board School</i> is doing good
educational service for the elevation of the humbler classes.</p>
<p>Turning from Great Saffron Hill westward by the <i>One Tun</i>
public-house, we come into <i>Charles Street</i>, on the south
side of which, towards Hatton Garden, is <b>Bleeding Hart
Yard</b> (entrance by the Bleeding Hart Tavern, No. 19).&nbsp;
This locality is associated with the tale of &ldquo;Little
Dorrit.&rdquo;&nbsp; It will be remembered that here the factory
of <i>Messrs. Doyce and Clennam</i> was situated, and here also
resided <i>Mr. and Mrs. Plornish</i>, the humble friends of the
Dorrit family.&nbsp; In these degenerate days the place has much
altered, and the amiable <i>Mr. Casby</i> would certainly find it
more difficult than ever to collect his weekly dues, even by the
agency of his energetic assistant, Mr. Pancks.</p>
<p>Passing from this unpretending locality, we come (at No. 8)
into <i>Hatton Garden</i>, which leads southward to <i>Holborn
Circus</i>.</p>
<p>In Hatton Garden, on the east side, can be observed (No. 20)
the old-established warehouse of <b>Messrs. Rowland and
Son</b>.&nbsp; In this connection there may be remembered the mad
old gentleman &ldquo;in small clothes,&rdquo; who lived next door
to the <i>Nicklebys</i>, at Bow.&nbsp; On the only occasion of
his visiting the family indoors, he incidentally referred to
&ldquo;Mrs. Rowland, who, every <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>morning, bathes in Kalydor for
nothing.&rdquo;&mdash;See &ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby,&rdquo;
chapter 49.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Waterbrook&rsquo;s</b> establishment, situated in
<i>Ely Place</i>, <i>Holborn</i>, is entitled to passing mention
as the place where David and his friend Traddles met each other
for the first time after their schoolboy days, on the occasion of
a dinner-party, at which also <i>Agnes Wickfield</i> and <i>Uriah
Heep</i> attended.&nbsp; Ely Place is situated on the north side
of <span class="smcap">Holborn Circus</span>, and once comprised
the rose garden of the Bishop of Ely, afterwards leased to Sir
Christopher Hatton.</p>
<p>On the opposite side of the Circus, and near to St.
Andrew&rsquo;s Church, is situated <b>Thavies Inn</b>, in which
<i>Mrs. Jellyby</i> and family resided, in the days when her
daughter <i>Caddy</i> acted as amanuensis <i>in re</i> the
affairs of Borrioboola-Gha.</p>
<p>It is described in &ldquo;Bleak House&rdquo; as being</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A narrow street of high houses like an
oblong cistern to hold the fog.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The house No. 13, on the right, has been indicated as once the
disorderly residence of the Jellyby family.&nbsp; We may
recollect it as the place where <i>Esther Summerson</i> and
<i>Ada</i> were accommodated for their first night in London, on
which occasion little unfortunate <i>Peepy</i> was found with his
head between the area railings, and the house generally turned
upside down; while Mrs. Jellyby serenely dictated her
correspondence in the family sitting-room, altogether oblivious
of such minor domestic accidents.</p>
<p>Esther thus narrates her first impressions:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mrs. Jellyby had very good hair, but was
too much occupied with her African duties to brush it.&nbsp; The
shawl in which she had been loosely muffled dropped on to her
chair, when she advanced towards us; and, as she turned to resume
her seat, we could not help noticing that her dress didn&rsquo;t
nearly meet up the back, and that the open space was railed
across with a lattice work of staylace&mdash;like a summer house.
. . .&nbsp; &lsquo;You find me, my dears,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Jellyby, &lsquo;as usual, very busy; but that you will
excuse.&nbsp; The African project at present employs my whole
time. . . .&nbsp; We hope by this time next year to have from a
hundred <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>and fifty to two hundred healthy families cultivating
coffee and educating the natives of Borrioboola-Gha, on the left
bank of the Niger.&rdquo;&mdash;See &ldquo;Bleak House,&rdquo;
chapter 4.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>The Buffet of Messrs. Spiers and Pond</i> will be found a
short distance eastward from Holborn Circus, on the right, next
the terminus of the London, Chatham, and Dover railway.&nbsp; A
visit to its welcome &ldquo;contiguity of shade&rdquo; is
confidently recommended to those who may be disposed for
necessary rest and refreshment.</p>

<p>From <span class="smcap">Holborn Circus</span> the Rambler now
proceeds westward by the main thoroughfare of <i>Holborn</i>,
passing <i>Fetter Lane</i> on the left, and arrives at (No. 26)
the old premises, now partially rebuilt, formerly
<b>Langdale&rsquo;s Distillery</b>.&nbsp; Half of the same
remains (at the moment), but will shortly be superseded by a
modern building.&nbsp; The eastern portion is occupied by Messrs.
<a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>Buchanan,
whisky merchants, who have recently purchased the premises.&nbsp;
This establishment was sacked (1780) by the Gordon rioters.&nbsp;
Mr. Langdale being a Catholic, was obnoxious to the No-Popery
mob; and the stores of liquor at this distillery afforded an
additional temptation for the attack.&nbsp; The terrible scenes
enacted on the occasion are powerfully described in
&ldquo;Barnaby Rudge,&rdquo; chapters 67 and 68&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At this place a large detachment of
soldiery were posted, who fired, now up Fleet Market, now up
Holborn, now up Snow Hill&mdash;constantly raking the streets in
each direction.&nbsp; At this place too, several large fires were
burning, so that all the terrors of that terrible night seemed to
be concentrated in one spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Full twenty times, the rioters, headed by one man who
wielded an axe in his right hand, and bestrode a brewer&rsquo;s
horse of great size and strength, caparisoned with fetters taken
out of Newgate, which clanked and jingled as he went, made an
attempt to force a passage at this point, and fire the
vintner&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; Full twenty times they were repulsed
with loss of life, and still came back again; and though the
fellow at their head was marked and singled out by all, and was a
conspicuous object as the only rioter on horseback, not a man
could hit him. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vintner&rsquo;s house, with half-a-dozen others
near at hand, was one great, glowing blaze.&nbsp; All night, no
one had essayed to quench the flames, or stop their progress; but
now a body of soldiers were actively engaged in pulling down two
old wooden houses, which were every moment in danger of taking
fire, and which could scarcely fail, if they were left to burn,
to extend the conflagration immensely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;. . .&nbsp; The gutters of the street, and every crack
and fissure in the stones, ran with scorching spirit, which being
dammed up by busy hands, overflowed the road and pavement, and
formed a great pool, into which the people dropped down dead by
dozens.&nbsp; They lay in heaps all round this fearful pond,
husbands and wives, fathers and sons, mothers and daughters,
women with children in their arms and babies at their breasts,
and drank until they died.&nbsp; While some stooped with their
lips to the brink and never raised their heads again, others
sprang up from their fiery draught, and danced, half in a mad
triumph, and half in the agony of suffocation, until they fell,
and steeped their corpses in the liquor that had killed them. . .
.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On this last night of the great riots&mdash;for the
last night it was&mdash;the wretched victims of a senseless
outcry, became themselves the dust and ashes of the flames they
had kindled, and strewed the public streets of London.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>It will
be remembered that Mr. Langdale and Mr. Haredale, being in the
house that night, were rescued by Edward Chester and Joe Willett,
all four finding their way to safety by a back entrance.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The narrow lane in the rear was quite free
of people.&nbsp; So, when they had crawled through the passage
indicated by the vintner (which was a mere shelving-trap for the
admission of casks), and had managed with some difficulty to
unchain and raise the door at the upper end, they emerged into
the street without being observed or interrupted.&nbsp; Joe still
holding Mr. Haredale tight, and Edward taking the same care of
the vintner, they hurried through the streets at a rapid
pace.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This door gives into Fetter Lane (No. 79), and still exists
for the inspection of the curious.&nbsp; The old house in Holborn
has, for more than a century, replaced the premises so
destroyed.&nbsp; Close at hand (by No. 23) is the entrance to
<b>Barnard&rsquo;s Inn</b>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The dingiest collection of shabby buildings
ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club for
tom-cats.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The locality is referred to in these complimentary terms by
Mr. Pip (in the pages of &ldquo;Great Expectations&rdquo;), who
lived here with his friend Herbert Pocket for a short time when
he first came to London.&nbsp; Mr. Joe Gargery&rsquo;s verdict is
worth remembrance:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The present may be a wery good inn, and I
believe its character do stand i; but I wouldn&rsquo;t keep a pig
in it myself, not in the case that I wished him to fatten
wholesome, and to eat with a meller flavour on him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pip further describes as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We entered this haven through a
wicket-gate, and were disgorged by an introductory passage into a
melancholy little square that looked to me like a flat
burying-ground.&nbsp; I thought it had the most dismal trees in
it, and the most dismal sparrows, and the most dismal cats, and
the most dismal houses (in number half-a-dozen or so), that I had
ever seen. . . .&nbsp; A frowzy mourning of soot and smoke
attired this forlorn creation of Barnard, and it had strewed
ashes on its head, and was undergoing penance and humiliation as
a mere dust-hole.&nbsp; Thus for my sense of sight; while dry
rot, and wet rot, and all the silent <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>rots that rot in neglected root and
cellar&mdash;rot of rat, and mouse, and bug, and coaching stables
near at hand besides&mdash;addressed themselves faintly to my
sense of smell, and moaned, &lsquo;Try Barnard&rsquo;s
Mixture.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great alterations are now (1899) being carried out; the old
buildings&mdash;as above referred to by Mr. Pip&mdash;have been
demolished, and a new and better arrangement of the locality is
in active progress for the improvement of the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>On the opposite side of Holborn are the handsome and extensive
offices of <span class="smcap">The Prudential Assurance
Company</span>.&nbsp; These premises, with their frontage, occupy
the site of <span class="smcap">Furnival&rsquo;s Inn</span>,
which has recently disappeared, having been pulled down to make
room for the extension of the Assurance offices above referred
to&mdash;<i>Sic transit memoria mundi</i>.</p>
<p><b>Furnival&rsquo;s Inn</b> was an interesting locality, as
associated with the earlier experience of Mr. Dickens
himself.&nbsp; Here the young author resided in 1835, the year
previous to the production of the &ldquo;Pickwick Papers,&rdquo;
the first number of that work being published April 1,
1836.&nbsp; On the day following that notable date, Mr. Dickens
married Miss Catherine Hogarth; and for some time the young
couple resided on the third floor apartments at <i>No.</i> 15
<i>Furnival&rsquo;s Inn</i>&mdash;on the right side of the
square.&nbsp; A personal reminiscence of these early days is no
doubt intended in chapter 59 of &ldquo;David Copperfield;&rdquo;
a pleasant description being there given of the residential
chambers of Mr. and Mrs. Traddles, as located in Gray&rsquo;s Inn
just beyond.</p>
<p><i>Mr. John Westlock</i> had his bachelor apartments in this
same place at Furnival&rsquo;s Inn (<i>vide</i> &ldquo;Martin
Chuzzlewit&rdquo;), and here he received the unexpected visit of
Tom Pinch on his first arrival in London.&nbsp; We may remember
the incidents of that cordial welcome, when</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;John was constantly running backwards and
forwards to and from the closet, bringing out all sorts of things
in pots, scooping extraordinary quantities of tea out of the
caddy, dropping French rolls into his boots, pouring hot water
over the butter, and making a variety of similar mistakes,
without disconcerting himself in the least.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>In the
centre of the interior square, standing within the precincts of
Furnival&rsquo;s Inn during the past seventy-five years, and
flourishing in recent days&mdash;a quiet oasis of retirement and
good cheer amidst the bustle and noise of central
London&mdash;there existed (until 1895) <b>Woods&rsquo;
Hotel</b>.&nbsp; This hotel was associated with &ldquo;The
Mystery of Edwin Drood,&rdquo; being the house at which Mr.
Grewgious found accommodation for the charming Rosa Budd (on the
occasion of her flight from the importunities of Jasper at
Cloisterham), including an &ldquo;unlimited head
chambermaid&rdquo; for her special behoof and benefit.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Rosa&rsquo;s room was airy, clean,
comfortable, almost gay.&nbsp; The Unlimited had laid in
everything omitted from the very little bag (that is to say,
everything she could possibly need), and Rosa tripped down the
great many stairs again, to thank her guardian for his thoughtful
and affectionate care of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not at all, my dear,&rsquo; said Mr. Grewgious,
infinitely gratified; &lsquo;it is I who thank you for your
charming confidence and for your charming company.&nbsp; Your
breakfast will be provided for you in a neat, compact, and
graceful little sitting-room (appropriate to your figure), and I
will come to you at ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&nbsp; I
hope you don&rsquo;t feel very strange indeed, in this strange
place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh no, I feel so safe!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, you may be sure that the stairs are
fire-proof,&rsquo; said Mr. Grewgious, &lsquo;and that any
outbreak of the devouring element would be perceived and
suppressed by the watchmen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I did not mean that,&rsquo; Rosa replied.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I mean, I feel so safe from him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There is a stout gate of iron bars to keep him
out,&rsquo; said Mr. Grewgious smiling; &lsquo;and
Furnival&rsquo;s is fire-proof, and specially watched and
lighted, and <i>I</i> live over the way!&rsquo;&nbsp; In the
stoutness of his knight-errantry, he seemed to think the
last-named protection all-sufficient.&nbsp; In the same spirit he
said to the gate-porter as he went out, &lsquo;If some one
staying in the hotel should wish to send across the road to me in
the night, a crown will be ready for the messenger.&rsquo;&nbsp;
In the same spirit, he walked up and down outside the iron gate
for the best part of an hour, with some solicitude; occasionally
looking in between the bars, as if he had laid a dove in a high
roost in a cage of lions, and had it on his mind that she might
tumble out.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Hotel was originally built 1818&ndash;19, and was enlarged
as recently as 1884.&nbsp; Woods was the proprietor for fifty
years.</p>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>Crossing to the other side of the street, at a short
distance onwards, opposite Gray&rsquo;s Inn Road, the Rambler
reaches (by No. 334 High Holborn) the gateway of <b>Staple
Inn</b>; a little nook, composed of two irregular quadrangles
behind the most ancient part of Holborn, where certain gabled
houses, some centuries of age, still stand looking on the public
way.&nbsp; Staple Inn was the favourite summer promenade of the
meditative <i>Mr. Snagsby</i> (see &ldquo;Bleak House&rdquo;);
and in this Inn <i>Mr. Grewgious</i> occupied a set of
chambers.&nbsp; The house is No. 10, in the inner quadrangle,
&ldquo;presenting in black and white, over its ugly portal, the
mysterious inscription, &lsquo;P. J. T., 1747.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Perhaps John Thomas, or Perhaps Joe Tyler.&rdquo;&nbsp; And,
under certain social conditions, &ldquo;for a certainty, P. J. T.
was Pretty Jolly Too.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Neville Landless</i> also
had rooms in this locality; the top set in the corner (on the
right), overlooking the garden &ldquo;where a few smoky sparrows
twitter in the smoky trees, as though they had called to each
other, &lsquo;let us play at country.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Close
to these lived <i>Mr. Tartar</i>, in &ldquo;the neatest, the
cleanest, and the best-ordered chambers ever seen under the sun,
moon, and stars.&rdquo;&nbsp; And we may recall the
writer&rsquo;s delicate treatment of this, the blushing
&ldquo;beanstalk country&rdquo; of dear little Rosa Budd.&nbsp;
For the several associations herewith connected, reference should
be made to our author&rsquo;s last book, &ldquo;The Mystery of
Edwin Drood.&rdquo;&mdash;See concluding paragraphs of chapter
21:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Rosa wondered what the girls would say if
they could see her crossing the wide street on the sailor&rsquo;s
arm.&nbsp; And she fancied that the passers-by must think her
very little and very helpless, contrasted with the strong figure
that could have caught her up and carried her out of any danger,
miles and miles without resting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was thinking further, that his far-seeing blue eyes
looked as if they had been used to watch danger afar off, and to
watch it without flinching, drawing nearer and nearer: when,
happening to raise her own eyes, she found that he seemed to be
thinking something about <i>them</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This a little confused Rosebud, and may account for her
never afterwards quite knowing how she ascended (with his help)
to his garden in the air, and seemed to get into a marvellous
country that <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>came into sudden bloom like the country on the summit of
the magic bean-stalk.&nbsp; May it flourish for ever!&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>In this connection, the reader may be interested in chapter
22; the first part of which deals most tenderly and beautifully
with &ldquo;love&rsquo;s awaking,&rdquo; in the heart of the
innocent heroine.</p>
<p>Recrossing to the other side of High Holborn, past
<i>Gray&rsquo;s Inn Road</i> (on the north), at No. 22, we reach
the gateway of <span class="smcap">Gray&rsquo;s Inn</span>.&nbsp;
At No. 2 South Square (formerly Holborn Court) we may find the
upper chambers formerly occupied by <i>Mr. Traddles</i> and his
wife <i>Sophy</i>, whose domestic arrangements included
accommodation for &ldquo;the beauty&rdquo; and the other
Devonshire sisters.&nbsp; Copperfield says, in the chapter before
referred to:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If I had beheld a thousand roses blowing in
a top set of chambers, in that withered Gray&rsquo;s Inn, they
could not have brightened it half so much.&nbsp; The idea of
those Devonshire girls, among the dry law-stationers, and the
attorneys&rsquo; offices; and of the tea and toast, and
children&rsquo;s songs, in that grim atmosphere of pounce and
parchment, red-tape, dusty wafers, ink-jars, brief and draft
paper, law reports, writs, declarations, and bills of costs,
seemed almost as pleasantly fanciful as if I had dreamed that the
Sultan&rsquo;s famous family had been admitted on the roll of
attorneys, and had brought the talking-bird, the singing-tree,
and the Golden water into Gray&rsquo;s Inn Hall.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The offices of <i>Mr. Perker</i>, the legal adviser of Mr.
Pickwick, were also located in Gray&rsquo;s Inn.&nbsp; We read
that the &ldquo;outer door&rdquo; of these chambers was to be
found &ldquo;after climbing two pairs of steep and dirty
stairs;&rdquo; but no indication is given of their exact
situation.</p>
<p>Proceeding westward from Gray&rsquo;s Inn, and passing the
stately, elegant, and commodious <i>First Avenue Hotel</i>,
between Warwick Court and Brownlow Street, and a half-a-dozen
side streets beyond, we come, on the north side, at No. 92, to
the <b>Bull and Anchor Tavern</b>.&nbsp; This is the house known
in the pages of &ldquo;Martin Chuzzlewit&rdquo; as &ldquo;<i>The
Bull Inn</i>,&rdquo; then a more important hostelry than at
present.&nbsp; It will be remembered as the inn at which Mr.
Lewsome, during his <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>illness, was professionally attended by <i>Sairey
Gamp</i> and <i>Betsy Prig</i>, &ldquo;turn and turn
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passing on to the next turning but one, we reach <b>Kingsgate
Street</b>, where <i>Poll Sweedlepipes</i>&mdash;barber and
bird-fancier&mdash;once had his business location, &ldquo;next
door but one to the celebrated mutton-pie shop, and directly
opposite the original cat&rsquo;s-meat warehouse.&rdquo;&nbsp; At
this place the immortal <i>Mrs. Gamp</i> had lodgings on the
first floor, where she</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Was easily assailed at night by pebbles,
walking-sticks, and fragments of tobacco pipes, all much more
efficacious than the street-door knocker, which was so
constructed as to wake the street with ease, and even spread
alarms of fire in Holborn, without making the smallest impression
on the premises to which it was addressed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is recollected in the neighbourhood that, fifty years
since, a barber by the name of Patterson (who was also a
bird-dealer) lived in this street, at the second house on the
left.&nbsp; The shop has been pulled down, is now absorbed by the
corner premises in Holborn, and can be only identified by its
position.&nbsp; Here, then, did <i>Mr. Pecksniff</i> arrive on
his doleful mission, in accordance with the recommendation of
<i>Mr. Mould</i>, the undertaker, with regard to the death of old
<i>Anthony Chuzzlewit</i>; and here did that memorable teapot
cause a lasting difference between two friends, as narrated in
chapter 49 of &ldquo;Martin Chuzzlewit.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This
world-famous personage, Mrs. Gamp, has passed into and become one
with the language&rdquo; whose vernacular she has adorned with
her own flowers of speech.&nbsp; As Mr. Forster remarks,
&ldquo;she will remain among the everlasting triumphs of fiction,
a superb masterpiece of English humour.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Age
cannot wither her, nor custom stale, her infinite
variety.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the Holborn corner of Kingsgate Street
we may remember <i>Mr. Bailey</i>, <i>junior</i>, on the occasion
when, at this exact spot, he collided with Poll Sweedlepipes,
afterwards going &ldquo;round and round in circles on the
pavement,&rdquo; the better to exhibit to Poll&rsquo;s admiring
gaze his fashionable livery as Tiger in the service of <i>Mr.
Montague Tigg</i>, &ldquo;rather to the <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>inconvenience
of the passengers generally, who were not in an equal state of
spirits with himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next turning but one, westward, on the right, by the West
Central Post Office (No. 126), is <b>Southampton Street</b>,
leading to Bloomsbury Square.</p>
<p>Here it will be remembered that lodgings were taken by Mr.
Grewgious for <i>Miss Twinkleton</i> and Rosa, of the redoubtable
<i>Mrs. Billickin</i>, &ldquo;the person of the
&rsquo;ouse,&rdquo; who, from prudential motives, suppressed her
Christian name.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr. Grewgious had his agreement-lines and
his earnest-money ready.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have signed it for the
ladies, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and you&rsquo;ll have
the goodness to sign it for yourself, Christian and Surname,
there, if you please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Grewgious,&rsquo; said Mrs. Billickin in a
new burst of candour, &lsquo;no, sir! You must excuse the
Christian name.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Grewgious stared at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The door-plate is used as a protection,&rsquo;
said Mrs. Billickin, &lsquo;and acts as such, and go from it I
will not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Grewgious stared at Rosa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, Mr. Grewgious, you must excuse me.&nbsp; So
long as this &rsquo;ouse is known indefinite as
Billickin&rsquo;s, and so long as it is a doubt with the
riff-raff where Billickin may be hidin&rsquo;, near the
street-door or down the airy, and what his weight and size, so
long I feel safe.&nbsp; But commit myself to a solitary female
statement, no, Miss!&nbsp; Nor would you for a moment
wish,&rsquo; said Mrs. Billickin, with a strong sense of injury,
&lsquo;to take that advantage of your sex, if you were not
brought to it by inconsiderate example.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosa reddening as if she had made some most disgraceful
attempt to overreach the good lady, besought Mr. Grewgious to
rest content with any signature.&nbsp; And accordingly, in a
baronial way, the sign-manual <span
class="smcap">Billickin</span> got appended to the
document.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And we may here recall the incidental passage of arms between
the worthy landlady and Miss Twinkleton, Mrs. B. being always in
direct antagonism with the schoolmistress, against whom she
&ldquo;openly pitted herself as one whom she fully ascertained to
be her natural enemy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Witness &ldquo;the B.
enveloped in the shawl of State,&rdquo; as she remarked to Miss
Twinkleton that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A rush from scanty feeding to
generous feeding, from what you may call messing to what you may
call method, do require a power of <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>constitution, which is not often
found in youth, particular when undermined by boarding-school. .
. .&nbsp; I was put in youth to a very genteel boarding-school,
the mistress being no less a lady than yourself, of about your
own age, or it may be some years younger, and a poorness of blood
flowed from the table, which has run through my life.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If you refer to the poverty of your
circulation,&rsquo; began Miss Twinkleton, when again the
Billickin neatly stopped her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have used no such expressions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If you refer, then, to the poorness of your
blood&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Brought upon me,&rsquo; stipulated the
Billickin, expressly, &lsquo;at a
boarding-school&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; resumed Miss Twinkleton, &lsquo;all
I can say is, that I am bound to believe, on your asseveration,
that it is very poor indeed.&nbsp; I cannot forbear adding, that
if that unfortunate circumstance influences your conversation, it
is much to be lamented, and it is eminently desirable that your
blood were richer.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Southampton Street is not a long one, and is now chiefly
occupied by solicitors and architects; but there is reason to
believe that the Billickins&rsquo; residence was, aforetime, to
be found at No. 18, which is situated next door but one to an
archway.&nbsp; As Mrs. B. herself candidly pointed out,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The arching leads to a mews; mewses must
exist.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mews aforesaid is now superseded by a factory.&nbsp; Mrs.
Billickin has long since relinquished the cares of housekeeping
and retired from public life.&nbsp; The present amiable landlady
conducts the business on different principles, and will be at all
times disposed to give her patrons satisfaction, whether they be
of the scholastic persuasion or otherwise.</p>
<p>Southampton Street leads immediately northward into
<b>Bloomsbury Square</b>.&nbsp; This place is mentioned in
&ldquo;Barnaby Rudge&rdquo; as the locality in which <i>Lord
Mansfield&rsquo;s</i> residence was situated at the period of the
Gordon Riots.&nbsp; In chapter 66 its destruction by the rioters
is thus described:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They began to demolish the house with great
fury; and setting fire to it in several places, involved in a
common ruin the whole of the costly furniture, the plate and
jewels, a beautiful gallery of pictures, the rarest collection of
manuscripts ever possessed by any one private <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>person in the
world, and, worst of all, because nothing could replace the loss,
the great Law Library, on almost every page of which were notes,
in the judge&rsquo;s own hand, of inestimable value; being the
results of the study and experience of his whole life.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>The house occupied the site of No. 29, on the east side of the
square.&nbsp; We subsequently read in the same book that two of
the rioters&mdash;cripples&mdash;were hanged in this square, the
execution being momentarily delayed, as they were placed facing
the house they had assisted to despoil.&nbsp; Leaving the square
at its north-east angle (right) by <i>Bloomsbury Place</i>, the
Rambler shortly comes into <i>Southampton Row</i>, turning left,
and proceeding for a short distance upwards to <i>Cosmo Place</i>
on the right, a short cut which leads directly to the contiguous
shades of <b>Queen Square</b> just beyond.&nbsp; It will be
remembered that in this neighbourhood Richard Carstone had
furnished apartments at the time when he was pursuing the
experimental study of the Law under the auspices of Messrs. Kenge
and Carboy (see &ldquo;Bleak House,&rdquo; chapter 18).&nbsp;
There is reason to believe that the &ldquo;quiet old&rdquo; house
intended was No. 28 <i>Devonshire Street</i>, leading from the
south-east angle of the square.</p>
<p>Leaving Queen Square by <i>Great Ormond Street</i> (eastward),
we immediately arrive, on the north side (No. 50), at <b>The
Children&rsquo;s Hospital</b>, adjacent to the Catholic Church
and Convent of St. John.&nbsp; In 1858, February 9th, a public
dinner was arranged, by way of charitable appeal, for funds
necessary to carry on and develop the work.&nbsp; It was happily
resolved to invite Charles Dickens to preside on that occasion,
and he &ldquo;threw himself into the service heart and
soul.&rdquo;&nbsp; His earnest, pathetic, but powerful
appeal&mdash;&ldquo;majestic in its own
simplicity&rdquo;&mdash;that night added more than &pound;3000 to
the treasury, which amount was, two months afterwards,
substantially increased by the proceeds of a public reading of
his &ldquo;Christmas Carol.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is pleasant to record
that this institution has ever since flourished amain, thus
fulfilling the prediction of Dickens when, suggesting <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>that the
enterprise could not be possibly maintained unless the Hospital
were made better known, he continued as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I limit myself to saying&mdash;better
known, because I will not believe that, in a Christian community
of fathers and mothers, and brothers and sisters, it can fail,
being better known, to be well and richly endowed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We may here recall the scene narrated in chapter 9 of
&ldquo;Our Mutual Friend,&rdquo; when <i>Johnny</i> makes his
will and arranges his affairs, leaving &ldquo;a kiss for the
boofer lady&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The family whom God had brought together
were not all asleep, but were all quiet.&nbsp; From bed to bed, a
light womanly tread and a pleasant fresh face passed in the
silence of the night.&nbsp; A little head would lift itself into
the softened light here and there, to be kissed as the face went
by&mdash;for these little patients are very loving&mdash;and
would then submit itself to be composed to rest again. . .
.&nbsp; Over most of the beds, the toys were yet grouped as the
children had left them when they last laid themselves down, and
in their innocent grotesqueness and incongruity they might have
stood for the children&rsquo;s dreams.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proceeding eastward by <i>Great Ormond Street</i> and turning
(left) through <i>Lamb&rsquo;s Conduit Street</i>, to its
northern end, we face the entrance of the <b>Foundling
Hospital</b>.&nbsp; This beneficent institution was established
by Captain Thomas Coram, about the middle of the last century,
and is associated with &ldquo;No Thoroughfare,&rdquo; the
Christmas number (and last in the series) of &ldquo;All the Year
Round,&rdquo; 1867.&nbsp; Visitors attending the morning service
of the <i>Foundling Church</i> on Sundays are admitted to the
children&rsquo;s <i>Dining-Hall</i> thereafter, and so may have
an opportunity of realising the scene portrayed by Dickens, when
the &ldquo;veiled lady&rdquo; induced a female attendant to point
out Walter Wilding:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The bright autumnal sun strikes freshly
into the wards; and the heavy-framed windows through which it
shines, and the panelled walls on which it shines, are such
windows, and such walls as pervade Hogarth&rsquo;s
pictures.&nbsp; Neat attendants silently glide about the orderly
and silent tables, the lookers-on move or stop as the fancy takes
them; comments in whispers on face such a number, from such a
window, are <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>not unfrequent&mdash;many of the faces are of a
character to fix attention.&nbsp; Some of the visitors from the
outside public are accustomed visitors.&nbsp; They have
established a speaking acquaintance with the occupants of
particular seats at the table, and halt at those points to say a
word or two.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In &ldquo;Little Dorrit,&rdquo; too, reference is made to this
institution, <i>in re</i> the adoption of Tattycoram by good Papa
and Mamma Meagles.&nbsp; In the times of Barnaby Rudge, the
London streets were not greatly extended northward beyond this
(now central) neighbourhood.&nbsp; We may remember that the
headquarters of the &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; Sim Tappertit, Hugh,
and Dennis were at <b>The</b> &ldquo;<b>Boot</b>&rdquo;
<b>Tavern</b>, which is described as</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A lone place of public entertainment,
situated in the fields at the back of the Foundling Hospital; a
very solitary spot at that period, and quite deserted after
dark.&nbsp; The Tavern stood at some distance from any high road,
and was only approachable by a dark and narrow lane.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proceeding onwards through <i>Guilford Street</i>, we reach
<i>Doughty Street</i>, <i>Mecklenburgh Square</i>, running
transversely north and south.&nbsp; On the east side we may note
<b>No. 48 Doughty Street</b>, as the house to which Dickens
removed from <i>Furnival&rsquo;s Inn</i>, in the early spring of
1837, and in which he lived two years and a half, previous to his
longer residence at <i>No.</i> 1 <i>Devonshire Terrace</i>.&nbsp;
In it &ldquo;Oliver Twist&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nicholas
Nickleby&rdquo; were written; and here, too, the early
friendship, which had been for some time steadily developing
between Dickens and Forster, became cemented for life.&nbsp; His
biographer says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nor had many weeks passed before he
addressed to me from Doughty Street, words which it is my
sorrowful pride to remember have had literal fulfilment.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I look back with unmingled pleasure to every link which
each ensuing week has added to the chain of our attachment.&nbsp;
It shall go hard, I hope, ere anything but death impairs the
toughness of a bond now so firmly riveted.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The route being retraced to the Foundling Hospital, and thence
continued through Guilford Street to <i>Russell </i><a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span><i>Square</i>, we turn (right) by <i>Woburn Place</i> to
<span class="smcap">Tavistock Square</span>, on the south side of
which (<span class="smcap">Tavistock Villas</span>) is situated
<b>Tavistock House</b>.&nbsp; To this residence Dickens removed
(from <span class="smcap">Devonshire Terrace</span>) in October
1851, retaining its possession for nearly ten years.&nbsp; During
this time &ldquo;Bleak House&rdquo; was completed, and
&ldquo;Hard Times,&rdquo; &ldquo;Little Dorrit,&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Tale of Two Cities&rdquo; were given to the world.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Tavistock House</span> is now transformed
into a Jewish College.&nbsp; <i>Hans Christian Andersen</i>,
visiting his friend in London, gives the following
description:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In Tavistock Square stands Tavistock
House.&nbsp; This and the strip of garden in front of it are shut
out from the thoroughfare by an iron railing.&nbsp; A large
garden, with a grass plat and high trees, stretches behind the
house, and gives it a countrified look in the midst of this coal
and gas steaming London.&nbsp; In the passage from street to
garden hung pictures and engravings.&nbsp; Here stood a marble
bust of Dickens, so like him, so youthful and handsome; and over
a bedroom door were inserted the bas-reliefs of Night and Day,
after Thorwaldsen.&nbsp; On the first floor was a rich library,
with a fireplace and a writing-table, looking out on the garden;
and here it was that in winter Dickens and his friends acted
plays to the satisfaction of all parties.&nbsp; The kitchen was
underground, and at the top of the house were the
bedrooms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaving this locality at the north-west angle, passing
<i>Gordon Square</i>, we turn (right) into <i>Gordon Street</i>,
and (left) through <i>Gower Place</i>, to <span
class="smcap">Gower Street</span>, on the west side of
which&mdash;opposite&mdash;is the house once bearing a large
brass plate on the door, announcing <b>Mrs. Dickens&rsquo;s
Establishment</b>, being the place at which Mrs. Dickens (mother
of Charles) endeavoured to set up a school during the difficult
times of 1822.&nbsp; The family lived here for a short time,
previous to the Marshalsea imprisonment of Dickens senior;
Charles being then a boy ten years of age.&nbsp; In the first
chapter of Forster&rsquo;s Biography is the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A house was soon found at number four,
Gower Street North; a large brass plate on the door announced
Mrs. Dickens&rsquo;s establishment; <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>and the result I can give in the
exact words of the then small actor in the comedy, whose hopes it
had raised so high: &lsquo;I left at a great many other doors a
great many circulars, calling attention to the merits of the
establishment.&nbsp; Yet nobody ever came to school, nor do I
recollect that anybody ever proposed to come, or that the least
preparation was made to receive anybody.&nbsp; But, I know that
we got on very badly with the butcher and baker; that very often
we had not too much for dinner; and that at last my father was
arrested.&rsquo;&nbsp; . . .&nbsp; Almost everything by degrees
was pawned or sold, little Charles being the principal agent in
these sorrowful transactions . . . until at last, even of the
furniture of Gower Street, number four, there was nothing left
except a few chairs, a kitchen table, and some beds.&nbsp; Then
they encamped, as it were, in the two parlours of the emptied
house, and lived there night and day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gower Street has been rearranged since that time (there is now
no Gower Street North), and the houses are renumbered.&nbsp; No.
145, near <i>Gower Street Chapel</i>, and other houses adjoining,
are now in the occupation of Messrs. Maple &amp; Co.; and this
No. 145 was the house then enumerated as No. 4 Gower Street
North.&nbsp; Mrs. Dickens&rsquo;s experience, it will be
remembered, has been pleasantly referred to in the pages of
&ldquo;Our Mutual Friend;&rdquo; the stately <i>Mrs. Wilfer</i>
therein making a similar experiment, with the same result.&nbsp;
In chapter 4 we read of <i>Rumpty&rsquo;s</i> return home from
business: when</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Something had gone wrong with the house
door, for R. Wilfer stopped on the steps, staring at it, and
cried &lsquo;Hal-loa?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Wilfer, &lsquo;the man came himself with a pair of pincers and
took it off, and took it away.&nbsp; He said that as he had no
expectation of ever being paid for it, and as he had an order for
another <i>Ladies&rsquo; School</i> door-plate, it was better
(burnished up) for the interests of all
parties.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the opposite corner of the street is the <i>Gower Street
Station</i> of the Metropolitan Railway, at which train may be
taken to <i>Baker Street</i>.&nbsp; On arrival, we turn to the
right, by <i>Marylebone Road</i>, to <b>Devonshire Terrace</b>,
consisting of three houses at the northern end of <i>High
Street</i>,<i> Marylebone</i>.&nbsp; No. 1, now occupied by a
legal firm, was for twelve years the residence of Charles Dickens
(when in town).&nbsp; It is described by Forster as</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>&ldquo;A handsome house with a garden of considerable
size, shut out from the New Road by a brick wall, facing the York
Gate into Regent&rsquo;s Park.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To quote the ironical dictum of its future tenant when the
choice was made, it was &ldquo;a house of great promise (and
great premium), undeniable situation, and excessive
splendour.&rdquo;&nbsp; During the period of the author&rsquo;s
residence here several of his best-known books were given to the
world&mdash;&ldquo;Master Humphrey&rsquo;s Clock,&rdquo; <span
class="smcap">Christmas Books</span>, and &ldquo;David
Copperfield&rdquo; included.&nbsp; Proceeding forwards and
eastward past <i>Devonshire Place</i>, we may take our way,
turning on the right down <b>Harley Street</b>, of which we read
in &ldquo;Little Dorrit&rdquo; that,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Like unexceptionable society, the opposing
rows of houses in Harley Street were very grim with one
another.&nbsp; Indeed, the mansions and their inhabitants were so
much alike in that respect that the people were often to be found
drawn up on opposite sides of dinner tables, in the shade of
their own loftiness, staring at the other side of the way with
the dulness of the houses.&nbsp; Everybody knows how like the
street the two dinner-rows of people who take their stand by the
street will be.&nbsp; The expressionless uniform twenty houses,
all to be knocked at and rung at in the same form, all
approachable by the same dull steps, all fended off by the same
pattern of railing, all with the same impracticable fire-escapes,
the same inconvenient fixtures in their heads, and everything,
without exception, to be taken at a high valuation&mdash;who has
not dined with these?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this street lived that great financier and swindler <i>Mr.
Merdle</i>, who had his residence in one of the handsomest of
these handsome houses; but it would be, perhaps, invidious to
point out any particular location for the same, Dickens himself
having purposely omitted an exact address.&nbsp; Following the
course of Harley Street, we come in due time to <span
class="smcap">Queen Anne Street</span>, running east and
west.&nbsp; Adopting the leftward turning (east), we may find at
the next corner&mdash;<i>Mansfield Street</i>&mdash;on the north
side, <b>Mr. Dombey&rsquo;s House</b>, as described in chapter 3
of &ldquo;Dombey and Son&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr. Dombey&rsquo;s house was a large one,
on the shady side of a tall, <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>dark, dreadfully genteel street in
the region between Portland Place and Bryanston Square.&nbsp; It
was a corner house, with great wide areas containing cellars,
frowned upon by barred windows, and leered at by crooked-eyed
doors leading to dust-bins.&nbsp; It was a house of dismal state,
with a circular back to it, containing a whole suite of
drawing-rooms looking upon a gravelled yard.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be observed that the position and character of this
mansion exactly correspond to the above description, being in its
general style noteworthy and unique.&nbsp; This, then, was the
private establishment and &ldquo;home department&rdquo; of the
Dombey family, where died the gentle Paul; the lonely house in
which the neglected Florence grew to lovely womanhood; what time
the second wife&mdash;the stately Edith&mdash;held temporary
sway.</p>
<p>Hence a short distance southward leads to <i>Cavendish
Square</i>.&nbsp; In this neighbourhood we read that <b>Madame
Mantalini&rsquo;s</b> fashionable dressmaking establishment was
situated, at which Kate Nickleby was for some few weeks engaged,
on the recommendation of her uncle.&nbsp; The house intended was
probably in <i>Wigmore Street</i>, No. 11.&nbsp; In the days of
the Mantalini <i>r&eacute;gime</i> the business was
advertised</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To the nobility and gentry by the casual
exhibition, near the handsomely-curtained windows, of two or
three elegant bonnets of the newest fashion, and some costly
garments in the most approved taste.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the next turning (right) on the north side we come into
<span class="smcap">Wimpole Street</span>; on the east of which,
at the corner of the third block, stands <b>The West End
Residence</b>&mdash;No. 43&mdash;aforetime occupied by Mr. and
Mrs. Boffin; which became, later on, the property of Mr. John
Harmon and his wife.&nbsp; It is described as &ldquo;a corner
house, not far from Cavendish Square.&rdquo;&nbsp; Near this
house <i>Silas Wegg</i>&mdash;assuming some knowledge of its
affairs&mdash;kept his street-stall.&nbsp; He was accustomed to
refer to it as &ldquo;Our House,&rdquo; its (imaginary) inmates
being Miss Elizabeth, Master George, Aunt Jane, and Uncle
Parker.</p>
<p><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>Returning to Wigmore Street, we arrive by the next block
at <b>Welbeck Street</b>, running transversely thereto.&nbsp; In
this street was the London residence of <i>Lord George
Gordon</i>, as referred to in the pages of &ldquo;Barnaby
Rudge.&rdquo;&nbsp; The house is No. 64, the second from Wigmore
Street on the left side.&nbsp; It is within the recollection of
the present landlord that the old balcony&mdash;from which Lord
George was wont to harangue the public&mdash;was many years since
superseded by the present continuous railing.</p>
<p>We now come south into the West-end artery of <i>Oxford
Street</i>, crossing same to <i>Davies Street</i>, by which we
may soon reach <span class="smcap">Brook Street</span>, <span
class="smcap">Grosvenor Square</span>, running east and
west.&nbsp; On the south-eastern angle of its intersection stands
<b>Claridge&rsquo;s Hotel</b>.&nbsp; It will be remembered that
on <i>Mr. Dorrit&rsquo;s</i> return from the Continent, after the
marriage of his daughter Fanny, &ldquo;the Courier had not
approved of his staying at the house of a friend, and had
preferred to take him to an hotel in Brook Street, Grosvenor
Square.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was doubtless the establishment
favoured by the Courier&rsquo;s preference on that occasion; and
where Mr. Merdle paid a state visit to Mr. Dorrit at
breakfast-time the next morning; taking him afterwards in his
carriage to the City.</p>
<p>Readers of &ldquo;Dombey and Son&rdquo; may be reminded that
the <b>Feenix Town House</b> was situated in this same <span
class="smcap">Brook Street</span>; but no clue is afforded of its
exact whereabouts.&nbsp; It is described as an aristocratic
mansion of a dull and gloomy sort; and was borrowed by the
<i>Honourable Mrs. Skewton</i> from a stately relative, on the
occasion of her daughter&rsquo;s marriage.&nbsp; Here also, in
aftertime, the final interview between <i>Florence</i> and
<i>Edith</i> took place.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Keeping on through <i>Davies Street</i> across <i>Berkeley
Square</i>, we come through <i>Berkeley Street</i> to Piccadilly,
in the close vicinity of <b>Devonshire House</b>, a mansion of
fashionable and political repute, belonging to the <i>Duke of
Devonshire</i>.&nbsp; Here, on <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>the 27th of May 1851, in the great
drawing-room and library, Dickens and his <i>confr&egrave;res</i>
of &ldquo;The Guild of Literature and Art&rdquo; performed, for
the first time, Sir Bulwer Lytton&rsquo;s comedy (written for the
occasion) &ldquo;Not so Bad as We Seem,&rdquo; in the presence of
the Queen, Prince Albert and a brilliant audience.&nbsp; The Duke
not only afforded the necessary accommodation, but (as Mr.
Forster writes), in his princely way, discharged all attendant
expenses.&nbsp; Many distinguished authors and artists assisted
at this performance, including Douglas Jerrold, Maclise, and John
Leech.</p>
<p>Near at hand, on the eastern corner of the next turning down
Piccadilly (<i>Dover Street</i>), is <span
class="smcap">Hatchett&rsquo;s Hotel</span>, adjoining <b>The
White Horse Cellars</b>, once a well-known coaching
establishment.&nbsp; On the opposite side of the way stood in
days of yore the old &ldquo;White Horse Cellars,&rdquo; of which
Hazlitt writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The finest sight in the Metropolis is the
setting out of the mail-coaches from Piccadilly.&nbsp; The horses
paw the ground and are impatient to be gone, as if conscious of
the precious burden they convey.&nbsp; There is a peculiar
secrecy and despatch, significant and full of meaning, in all the
proceedings concerning them.&nbsp; Even the outside passengers
have an erect and supercilious air, as if proof against the
accidents of the journey; in fact, it seems indifferent whether
they are to encounter the summer&rsquo;s heat or the
winter&rsquo;s cold, since they are borne through the air on a
winged chariot.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this well-known Booking Office, <i>Mr. Pickwick</i> and
his friends&mdash;accompanied by the fierce <i>Dowler</i> and his
fascinating wife&mdash;started for Bath, one &ldquo;muggy, damp,
and drizzly morning, by the mail coach; on the door of which was
displayed, in gilt letters of a goodly size, the magic name of
&lsquo;Pickwick&rsquo;; a circumstance which seems to have
occasioned some confusion of ideas in the mind of the faithful
Sam, as evidenced by his indignant
inquiry&mdash;&lsquo;An&rsquo;t nobody to be whopped for
takin&rsquo; this here liberty?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Readers of &ldquo;Bleak House&rdquo; will remember this
locality as the destination of the Reading Coach; so indicated by
<i>Messrs. Kenge and Carboy</i> in their first communication to
<a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span><i>Esther
Summerson</i>.&nbsp; Here she was met, one foggy November
afternoon, on her arrival in London, by the susceptible <i>Mr.
Guppy</i>, and by him conducted to Old Square, Lincoln&rsquo;s
Inn.&nbsp; The incident was afterwards feelingly referred to by
that young gentleman, on the occasion of his offer of heart,
hand, and income to Esther:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I think you must have seen that I was
struck with those charms on the day when I waited at the
Whytorseller.&nbsp; I think you must have remarked that I could
not forbear a tribute to those charms when I put up the steps of
the &rsquo;ackney coach.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the full narrative, see &ldquo;Bleak House,&rdquo; chapter
9.</p>
<p>The Rambler can now take an eastward course up <span
class="smcap">Piccadilly</span>, and may casually observe, on the
left, past Burlington House, <span class="smcap">The
Albany</span>, where <i>Mr. Fledgby</i> had chambers.&nbsp; The
next turning on the same side is <span class="smcap">Sackville
Street</span>, in which it may be recollected that <i>Mr. and
Mrs. Lammles</i> resided during the short term of their social
prosperity.&nbsp; Mention of these localities in such connection
will be found in the pages of &ldquo;Our Mutual
Friend.&rdquo;&nbsp; Passing onwards on the same side, we arrive
at No. 28, <b>St. James&rsquo;s Hall</b>.&nbsp; It was at this
well-known place of assembly that several of those popular
Readings were given by Charles Dickens, which always commanded
the attention and sympathetic interest of his audience.&nbsp; On
these occasions he invariably adopted the extreme of fashionable
evening attire, being dressed in irreproachable style, with,
perhaps, more of shirt-front than waistcoat; and so &ldquo;got
up&rdquo; as to present a staginess and juvenility of appearance,
possibly somewhat out of keeping with his time of life.&nbsp;
Some of his hearers may have desired a more natural and less
conventional mode; but they knew that beneath the big shirt and
fashionable coat, there throbbed the genial heart of the man they
loved, as he read of the sorrows of &ldquo;Little Emily,&rdquo;
or stood with them in spirit at the bedside of &ldquo;Paul
Dombey.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the occasion of his final Reading, given
here in March 1870, he tendered his last public farewell to his
London audience in the following words:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>&ldquo;It would be worse than idle, it would be
hypocritical and unfeeling, if I were to disguise that I close
this episode of my life with feelings of very considerable
pain.&nbsp; For some fifteen years, in this hall and many kindred
places, I have had the honour of presenting my own cherished
ideas before you for your recognition; and, in closely observing
your reception of them, have enjoyed an amount of artistic
delight and enjoyment, which perhaps it is given few men to
know.&nbsp; In this task and every other, I have ever undertaken
as a faithful servant of the public&mdash;always imbued with a
sense of duty to them, and always striving to do his best&mdash;I
have been uniformly cheered by the readiest response, the most
generous sympathy and the most stimulating support.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, I have thought it well, at the full flood-tide of
your favour, to retire upon those older associations between us,
which date from much further back than these; and henceforth to
devote myself exclusively to the art that first brought us
together.&nbsp; Ladies and gentlemen, in but two short weeks from
this time, I hope that you may enter, in your own homes, on a new
series of Readings, at which my assistance will be indispensable;
but from these garish lights I vanish now for ever, with one
heartfelt, grateful, respectful, and affectionate
farewell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the right-hand side of Piccadilly, adjacent to the
<i>Prince&rsquo;s Hall and Institute of Painters</i>, there may
be noted, <i>en passant</i>, the premises No. 193, now occupied
by the Boys&rsquo; Messenger Co.&nbsp; This, for many years, was
the address of <b>Messrs. Chapman and Hall</b>, the publishers of
the works of Dickens.&nbsp; Previous to 1850, the earlier
books&mdash;&ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; to &ldquo;Martin
Chuzzlewit&rdquo; inclusive&mdash;together with the first issue
of their cheaper edition, were published by this well-known house
at 186 <i>Strand</i>, the site now occupied by the premises of W.
H. Smith and Son.&nbsp; The firm have, for many years past,
removed their offices to <i>No.</i> 11 <i>Henrietta Street</i>,
<i>Covent Garden</i>.</p>
<p>Passing on to <i>Piccadilly Circus</i>, and crossing northward
from the same, we turn (left) into <i>Sherwood Street</i>, which
leads, by a short walk, to <i>Brewer Street</i>, in the
neighbourhood of <span class="smcap">Golden Square</span>.&nbsp;
Continuing by <i>Lower James Street</i>, opposite, we reach the
square itself, in which was formerly situated the <b>Office of
Ralph Nickleby</b>.&nbsp; Readers of Dickens will remember that
it was a large house, with an attic storey, in which Ralph
committed suicide.&nbsp; The house No. 6, on <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>the east
side, was probably the one assigned by the author as the
usurer&rsquo;s residence.&nbsp; It is now let off in various
suites of offices, professional and otherwise.&nbsp; The
neighbourhood has somewhat changed since the time when the
&ldquo;Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby&rdquo; was first issued,
and the following description, given by Dickens, became public
property:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is one of the squares that have
been&mdash;a quarter of the town that has gone down in the world,
and taken to letting lodgings.&nbsp; Many of its first and second
floors are let, furnished, to single gentlemen, and it takes
boarders besides.&nbsp; It is a great resort of foreigners.&nbsp;
The dark-complexioned men who wear large rings and heavy
watch-guards, and bushy whiskers, and who congregate under the
Opera Colonnade, and about the box-office in the season between
four and five in the afternoon, when they give away the
orders&mdash;all live in Golden Square, or within a street of
it.&nbsp; Two or three violins and a wind instrument from the
opera-band reside within its precincts.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We read in the same book of the whereabouts of <i>Mr.
Kenwigs</i> as being in this neighbourhood&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A bygone, faded, tumble-down street, with
two irregular rows of tall meagre houses, which seem to have
stared each other out of countenance years ago; the very chimneys
appear to have grown dismal and melancholy from having had
nothing better to look at than the chimneys over the
way.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many streets in the district of Soho, in this
vicinity, which will in some respects correspond with the
description given; but much alteration has taken place during the
last sixty years.&nbsp; Recollecting that <i>Newman Noggs</i>
lodged in the upper part of the same house, it must have been
conveniently near Golden Square.&nbsp; In <b>Carnaby Street</b>
(immediately north of the Square) there may be remarked a
white-fronted, old-fashioned house (No. 48), which, being in
proximity to Ralph Nickleby&rsquo;s Office, may be assigned as
aforetime comprising the apartments of the Kenwigs Family.</p>
<p>At the corner of <i>Beak Street</i> and <i>Upper James
Street</i> is still existent &ldquo;<b>The Crown Inn</b>,&rdquo;
well known to Newman Noggs; though, since his time, it must have
undergone <a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>considerable alteration.&nbsp; In his first letter to
Nicholas Nickleby, Newman writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you ever want a shelter in London, . . . they know
where I live at the sign of the Crown, Golden Square.&nbsp; It is
at the corner of Silver Street&rdquo; [now Beak Street]
&ldquo;and James Street, with a bar door both ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this neighbourhood, also, <b>Martha&rsquo;s Lodgings</b>
were situated, in the days of David Copperfield, who
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;She laid her hand on my arm, and hurried me
on to one of the sombre streets of which there are several in
that part, where the houses were once fair dwellings, in the
occupation of single families, but have, and had, long
degenerated into poor lodgings let off in rooms.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such a house may be found in <i>Marshall Street</i>, No. 53,
close at hand.&nbsp; But at this distance of time it is difficult
to assign the exact locality intended by Dickens.&nbsp; We are
all familiar with the welcome episode in David&rsquo;s history
when Martha rescued <i>Little Emily</i>, bringing her to these
lodgings, and <i>Mr. Peggotty&rsquo;s</i> dream came
true.&mdash;See chapter 50.</p>
<p>Proceeding half-way up <i>Marshall Street</i>, we turn (right)
through <i>Broad Street</i>, to (left) <i>Poland Street</i>, by
which we again attain the main thoroughfare of Oxford
Street.&nbsp; Turning eastward, on the north side, we come at a
short distance (by No. 90) to <b>Newman Street</b>, in which was
situated <i>Mr. Turveydrop&rsquo;s Dancing Academy</i>,
&ldquo;established in a sufficiently dingy house, at the corner
of an archway&rdquo; (Newman Passage), with Mr.
Turveydrop&rsquo;s great room built out into a mews at the
back.&nbsp; The house intended is No. 26, on the east side of the
street.&nbsp; Here <i>Caddy Jellyby</i> resided with her husband,
<i>Prince Turveydrop</i>, in the upper rooms of the
establishment, leaving the better part of the house at the
disposal of Mr. Turveydrop, senior; that &ldquo;perfect
model&rdquo; of parental and social
&ldquo;deportment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Returning to Oxford Street and
passing onwards on the south side, we shortly arrive at <i>Dean
Street</i>, leading southward.</p>
<p><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>At a
short distance, running east and west, is <b>Carlisle Street</b>,
at the further end of which, to the right, is an old house (by
name Carlisle House) which stands facing the observer.&nbsp; It
is now occupied by <i>Messrs. Edwards and Roberts</i>, dealers in
antique furniture.&nbsp; Readers of &ldquo;The Tale of Two
Cities&rdquo; will recollect the lodgings of <b>Doctor
Manette</b> and daughter Lucie, as described in the 6th chapter
(Book the Second) of the Tale, being situated in a quiet
street-corner, not far from Soho Square:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A quainter corner than the corner where the
Doctor lived was not to be found in London.&nbsp; There was no
way through it, and the front windows of the Doctor&rsquo;s
lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that had a
congenial air of retirement on it.&nbsp; There were few buildings
then, north of the Oxford Road, and forest-trees flourished, and
wild flowers grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now
vanished fields.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The garden behind the house, referred to in the
above-mentioned book, has been converted to the uses of a
warehouse, a glass roof having been long ago built over the
same.&nbsp; A paved court now exists at the side for the
convenience of foot-passengers, giving egress at the end of
Carlisle Street, so that the &ldquo;wonderful echoes&rdquo; which
once resounded in this &ldquo;curious corner&rdquo; are now no
longer to be heard.</p>
<p>It may be interesting to note that a thoroughfare leading from
<i>No.</i> 119 <i>Charing Cross Road</i> to <i>No.</i> 6 <i>Greek
Street</i>, <i>Soho</i>, is now named <i>Manette Street</i>; in
remembrance of the worthy Doctor, whose London residence in
Carlisle Street, as indicated, was near at hand.</p>
<p>We may return to Oxford Street through Soho Square,
conveniently terminating the ramble at Tottenham Court Road, just
beyond.&nbsp; From this central point there is omnibus
communication to all parts of London; and a commodious
resting-place may be here recommended to those disposed for
dinner, at <span class="smcap">The Horseshoe Restaurant</span>;
which stands in a prominent position near at hand, on the east
side of the street.</p>

<p><i>Tom Pinch</i>, diffident of requesting information in

Bank of England,</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>&ldquo;He would step in, and ask a civil question or
two, confiding in the perfect respectability of the
concern.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adopting the route <i>vi&acirc; Lombard Street</i>, we come,
on the left (No. 56), to <span class="smcap">George Yard</span>,
traversing which, there will be found, at the corner of Castle
Court (No. 3), the <b>George and Vulture Inn</b>, at which Mr.
Pickwick resided when in London, subsequent to his removal from
Goswell Street; and which has honourable mention in the history
of the Pickwickians.</p>
<p>Through <i>Lombard Street</i>, and turning left into
<i>Gracechurch Street</i>, we shortly arrive, on the right, at
<i>Bull&rsquo;s Head Passage</i> (turning by the Branch Post
Office, No. 82), in which, at No. 4, is the <span
class="smcap">Green Dragon Tavern</span>, in close proximity to
Leadenhall Market.&nbsp; This is, in all probability, the house
mentioned in &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; as &ldquo;<b>The Blue
Boar</b>,&rdquo; <i>Leadenhall Market</i>, a favourite house of
call with the elder Weller, and the place where Sam indited his
&ldquo;Valentine&rdquo; to <i>Mary</i>, the pretty housemaid,
afterwards Mrs. Sam.&nbsp; But the neighbourhood of the Market
has undergone considerable renovation since the old
coaching-days, and it is difficult to fix the <i>locale</i> of
the tavern with certainty.</p>
<p>Proceeding onwards through <i>Gracechurch Street</i>, we come
into the thoroughfare of <span class="smcap">Cornhill</span>; and
at No. 73, on the opposite side, arrive at <b>Newman&rsquo;s
Court</b>.&nbsp; It will be remembered that in
&ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; the offices of <i>Messrs. Dodson and
Fogg</i> (Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s attorneys) are located in
Freeman&rsquo;s Court, Cornhill.&nbsp; There is no such place in
Cornhill; Freeman&rsquo;s Court being in Cheapside.&nbsp; It is
evident, therefore, that Dickens, for reasons of his own,
emulated the special contributor to the <i>Eatanswill
Gazette</i>, and so &ldquo;combined his information.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Taking Cornhill to be the locality intended, we shall find Dodson
and Fogg&rsquo;s Office at the furthest end of the Court, No. 4,
still associated with legal business, <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>being in possession of Messrs.
Witherby and Co., law stationers.</p>
<p>Passing onwards in Cornhill, past Bishopsgate Street, we come
into Leadenhall Street, and may be interested to note, at No. 157
(now an outfitting establishment), the original position of the
<span class="smcap">House of Sol Gills</span>, ships&rsquo;
instrument maker, at whose door was displayed the figure of</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Wooden Midshipman; eternally taking
observations of the hackney coaches.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here our eccentric friend <i>Captain Cuttle</i> remained in
charge during the absence of old Sol Gills and his nephew; here
<i>Florence</i>, accompanied by the faithful Diogenes, found
asylum; and here <i>Walter Gay</i> returned after shipwreck, to
make everybody happy and marry the gentle heroine of the
story.&nbsp; (See &ldquo;Dombey and Son&rdquo; for information
<i>in extenso.</i>)&nbsp; Until recent years, these premises were
in occupation of Messrs. Norie and Wilson, ships&rsquo;
instrument makers and chart publishers.&nbsp; They have removed
to the Minories, No. 156, where the quaint effigy of <i>the
Wooden Midshipman</i>, with his cocked hat and quadrant complete,
may now be seen, as bright and brisk as in old days.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When found, make a note of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farther on, on the same side of Leadenhall Street, we reach
<b>St. Mary Axe</b>, turning northward at No. 117, which we
notice <i>en passant</i> as the thoroughfare in which <i>Pubsey
and Co.</i> had their place of business; &ldquo;a yellow
overhanging plaster-fronted house&rdquo;&mdash;reconstructed,
with many others, some years since&mdash;at the top of which
<i>Riah</i> (the manager) arranged his town garden; where the
Dolls&rsquo; Dressmaker invited <i>Fascination Fledgby</i> to
&ldquo;come up and be dead.&rdquo;&nbsp; All of which is duly set
forth in the pages of &ldquo;Our Mutual Friend.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
position of the house cannot now be localised.</p>
<p>Proceeding to the other end of St. Mary Axe, we may turn
(right) into <i>Bevis Marks</i>, where there once existed the <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span><b>House of
Mr. Sampson Brass</b>, No. 10, but this and others have long
since been rebuilt and re-enumerated.&nbsp; Here lived that
honourable attorney and his sister the fair Sally; aided in their
professional duties by a young gentleman of eccentric habits and
&ldquo;prodigious talent of quotation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here the
<i>Marchioness</i> lived, or rather starved, in attendance as
maid-of-all-work, and first made the acquaintance of Dick
Swiveller, her future husband; being by him initiated into the
mysteries of cribbage and the peculiarities of purl.&nbsp; Here
lodged the &ldquo;single gentleman,&rdquo; who evinced such
exceptional interest in the national drama, and so discovered a
clue to the retreat of Little Nell and her grandfather.</p>
<p>On the north side of the street there still flourishes the old
<span class="smcap">Red Lion Inn</span>, an establishment
patronised in his time by Mr. Richard, and once eulogised by that
gentleman on the occasion of his specifying &ldquo;the contingent
advantages&rdquo; of the neighbourhood.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is
mild porter in the immediate vicinity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For these and the other associations of this spot the tourist
is referred to the pages of the &ldquo;Old Curiosity
Shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following downwards through Bevis Marks and Duke Street
beyond, we come into <i>Aldgate</i>, keeping still on the
left-hand side of the way to <i>Aldgate High Street</i>, where at
a short distance we pass the Station of the Metropolitan
Railway.&nbsp; At No. 24, just ahead, is the <b>Bull Inn
Yard</b>, once the City Terminus of Coaches travelling
north-east.&nbsp; From this point Mr. Pickwick started per coach
for Ipswich, accompanied by the red-haired Mr. Peter Magnus; Mr.
Tony Weller officiating as driver.&nbsp; On which occasion we
read that Mr. Weller&rsquo;s conversation, &ldquo;possessing the
inestimable charm of blending amusement with instruction,&rdquo;
beguiled &ldquo;the tediousness of the journey during the greater
part of the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning westward on the other side of the way, the Rambler
may turn, at No. 81, into the <i>Minories</i>; and, at the second
house on the right, may observe the figure of <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span><i>the Wooden
Midshipman</i>, previously referred to as removed from its
original position in Leadenhall Street.&nbsp; The route being
continued (same side) from the Minories, we can note, as we pass
into <i>Fenchurch Street</i>, <b>Aldgate Pump</b>, standing at
the top of Leadenhall Street.&nbsp; There is a reference to this
old pump in &ldquo;Dombey,&rdquo; as being a stated object of
<i>Mr. Toots&rsquo;s</i> special evening excursions from
&ldquo;The Wooden Midshipman,&rdquo; when that gentleman desired
some temporary relief from the hopeless contemplation of Walter
Gay&rsquo;s happiness.</p>
<p>The tourist will now soon arrive at (No. 42) <b>Mincing
Lane</b>, leading to Great Tower Street.&nbsp; This short street
is entirely occupied by wholesale merchants and brokers, and it
will be remembered that <i>Messrs. Chicksey</i>,
<i>Veneering</i>, <i>and Stobbles</i>, wholesale druggists,
flourished in this locality in the days of the &ldquo;Golden
Dustman.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fourth house on the left from Fenchurch
Street, next to <i>Dunster Court</i>, has been indicated as the
probable whereabouts of the firm.&nbsp; We may remember that R.
Wilfer&rsquo;s office was on the ground-floor, next the
gateway.</p>
<p>Here, then, in this prosaic neighbourhood, <i>John
Rokesmith</i>, following <i>Bella Wilfer</i>, came to the
warehouse where Little <i>Rumty</i> was sitting at the open
window at his tea, and much surprised that gentleman by a
declaration of love for his daughter; what time &ldquo;The Feast
of the Three Hobgoblins&rdquo; was so agreeably celebrated.&nbsp;
This place is also associated with other pleasant episodes
connected with the history of the Wilfer family, the details of
which are fully furnished in the pages of &ldquo;Our Mutual
Friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Proceeding through Mincing Lane, we turn to the right through
<i>Eastcheap</i>, which leads westward to the top of <span
class="smcap">Fish Street Hill</span>.&nbsp; The tourist now
proceeds southward, passing the <i>Monument</i> on the
left.&nbsp; At a short distance beyond (No. 34) we arrive at
<i>King&rsquo;s Head Court</i>, &ldquo;a small paved yard,&rdquo;
in which are certain city warehouses and a dairy.&nbsp; On the
south side of the court, now occupied by the warehouses
aforesaid, once stood the Commercial <b>Boarding-House of Mrs.
Todgers</b>&mdash;an old-fashioned abode <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>even in the
days of Mr. Pecksniff&mdash;which has long since given place to
other commercial considerations.&nbsp; In the 9th chapter of
&ldquo;Martin Chuzzlewit&rdquo; full, true, and particular
account is given of this establishment as it used to be.&nbsp; We
may here call to remembrance the characters of <i>Bailey
junior</i>, <i>Mr. Jinkins</i>, <i>Augustus Moddle</i>, and
others in connection with the domestic economy of Mrs. Todgers
and the several Pecksniffian associations of the place; notably,
the festive occasion of that Sunday&rsquo;s dinner when Cherry
and Merry were first introduced to London society; the moral Mr.
Pecksniff thereafter exhibiting alarming symptoms of a chronic
complaint.&nbsp; (See chapter 9.)&nbsp; And we may indulge in a
kindly reminiscence of good-hearted Mrs. Todgers herself, worried
with the anxieties of &ldquo;gravy&rdquo; and the eccentricities
of commercial gentlemen.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps the Good Samaritan
was lean and lank, and found it hard to live.&rdquo;&nbsp; We now
come to <b>London Bridge</b>, the scene of Nancy&rsquo;s
interview with Mr. Brownlow and Rose Maylie (see &ldquo;Oliver
Twist&rdquo;), which took place on the steps near St.
Saviour&rsquo;s Church, on the Surrey side of the
river&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;These stairs are a part of the bridge; they
consist of three flights.&nbsp; Just below the end of the second,
going down, the stone wall on the left terminates in an
ornamental pilaster, facing towards the Thames.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it will be remembered that <i>Noah Claypole</i> here
ensconced himself as an unseen listener.</p>
<p>As we come to the Surrey side of the Thames, a passing thought
may be given to <i>Mrs. Rudge</i> and her son Barnaby, who lived
near at hand &ldquo;in a by-street in Southwark, not far from
London Bridge&rdquo;; and we may recall the incident of <i>Edward
Chester</i> being brought hither by <i>Gabriel Varden</i>, having
been found wounded by a highwayman on the other side of the
river.&nbsp; But it is altogether impossible to locate the house,
the neighbourhood having so entirely changed during the present
century.&nbsp; Onwards by the main thoroughfare of the Borough,
we shall find, on the left-hand side of the way (No. 61), the
(former) location of &ldquo;<b>The White Hart</b>,&rdquo;
described in &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; as</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>&ldquo;An old inn, which has preserved its external
features unchanged, and which has escaped alike the rage for
public improvement and the encroachments of private
speculation.&nbsp; A great, rambling, queer old place, with
galleries and passages and staircases, wide enough and antiquated
enough to furnish materials for a hundred ghost
stories.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The old inn has been pulled down some years since; the
original gateway only remains, leading to White Hart Yard.&nbsp;
A tavern and luncheon-bar of modern erection now occupy one side
of the old coach-yard in which <i>Messrs. Pickwick</i>,
<i>Wardle</i>, and <i>Perker</i> made their first acquaintance
with <i>Mr. Samuel Weller</i>, on that memorable occasion when
<i>Mr. Jingle</i> had eloped from <i>Dingley Dell</i> with
<i>Miss Rachael Wardle</i>, and had brought the lady to this
establishment.&nbsp; Farther on, towards the end of the Borough,
we arrive at Angel Place, a narrow passage near to St.
George&rsquo;s Church.&nbsp; It leads into <i>Marshalsea
Place</i>, of which Dickens writes as follows in his preface to
&ldquo;Little Dorrit&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whoever goes into Marshalsea Place, turning
out of Angel Court, leading to Bermondsey, will find his feet on
the very paving-stones of the extinct Marshalsea jail; will see
its narrow yard to the right, and to the left, very little
altered if at all, except that the walls were lowered when the
place got free; will look upon the rooms in which the debtors
lived; and will stand among the crowding ghosts of many miserable
years.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, then, was <b>The Marshalsea Prison</b>, in which, during
Dickens&rsquo;s youthful days, his father was imprisoned for
debt; and the place is intimately associated with the story of
<i>Little Dorrit</i> and her family.&nbsp; We must be all
familiar with the Father of the Marshalsea, his brother
Frederick, Maggie, and the several others of the <i>dramatis
person&aelig;</i> of that charming tale.</p>
<p><b>St. George&rsquo;s Church</b>, close at hand, will be
remembered in connection with the above, as once affording refuge
in its vestry for Little Dorrit, when the sexton accommodated her
with a bed formed of the pew-cushions, the book of registers
doing service as a pillow.&nbsp; She was afterwards married to
Arthur Clennam in this church.&nbsp; Full particulars <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>of the
ceremony will be found in the last chapter of the tale.&nbsp; At
a short distance from this point, down Blackman Street, on the
right, is (No. 90) <b>Lant Street</b>.&nbsp; In Forster&rsquo;s
Biography it is narrated that Dickens, when a boy, lodged in this
street what time his father was imprisoned in the
Marshalsea.&nbsp; The house stood on part of the site now
occupied by the Board School adjoining No. 46&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A back attic was found for me at the house
of an insolvent-court agent, who lived in Lant Street, in the
Borough, where <i>Bob Sawyer</i> lodged many years
afterwards.&nbsp; A bed and bedding were sent over for me, and
made up on the floor.&nbsp; The little window had a pleasant
prospect of a timber-yard; and when I took possession of my new
abode, I thought it was a Paradise.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This opinion of his boyhood seems to have been somewhat
modified fifteen years later, when the &ldquo;Pickwick
Papers&rdquo; were written, and Mr. Robert Sawyer had taken
residence in the locality.&nbsp; We read&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is an air of repose about Lant Street, in the
Borough, which sheds a gentle melancholy upon the soul.&nbsp; A
house in Lant Street would not come within the denomination of a
first-rate residence, in the strict acceptation of the term; but
it is a most desirable spot, nevertheless.&nbsp; If a man wished
to extract himself from the world, to remove himself from within
the reach of temptation, to place himself beyond the possibility
of any inducement to look out of the window, he should by all
means go to Lant Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walking onwards from &ldquo;this happy valley&rdquo; past
Suffolk Street, to the westward, turning off <i>Borough Road</i>,
we may note on the north corner the site of the old
<b>King&rsquo;s Bench Prison</b>, in which <i>Mr. Micawber</i>
was detained&mdash;in the top storey but one&mdash;pending the
settlement of his pecuniary liabilities.&nbsp; Later on in the
Copperfield history, Micawber appointed a meeting for David and
Tom Traddles as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Among other havens of domestic tranquillity
and peace of mind, my feet will naturally tend towards the
King&rsquo;s Bench Prison.&nbsp; In stating that I shall be
(D.V.) on the outside of the south wall of that place of
incarceration on civil process, the day after to-morrow, at <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>seven in the
evening, precisely, my object in this epistolary communication is
accomplished.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See chapter 49 for particulars of the subsequent
interview.&nbsp; This &ldquo;<i>dead wall</i>&rdquo; of the
prison is also mentioned in the same book as the place where
young David requested &ldquo;the long-legged young
man&rdquo;&mdash;who had charge of his box for conveyance to the
Dover coach-office&mdash;to stop for a minute while he (David)
tied on the address.&nbsp; It will be remembered that poor David
lost his box and his money on this occasion, when he started for
Dover,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Taking very little more out of the world,
towards the retreat of his aunt, Miss Betsy, than he had brought
into it on the night when his arrival gave her so much
umbrage;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the total sum of his remaining cash amounting to three
half-pence.&mdash;See chapter 12.</p>
<p>The first reference of our author to King&rsquo;s Bench Prison
will be found in &ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby&rdquo; (chapter 46), on
the occasion of the hero&rsquo;s first visit to <i>Madeline
Bray</i>, who resided with her father in one</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Of a row of mean and not over cleanly
houses, situated within &lsquo;the rules&rsquo; of the
King&rsquo;s Bench Prison; . . . comprising some dozen streets in
which debtors who could raise money to pay large fees&mdash;from
which their creditors did not derive any benefit&mdash;were
permitted to reside.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We learn from Allen&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of Surrey&rdquo;
that these rules comprehended all St. George&rsquo;s Fields, one
side of Blackman Street, and part of the Borough High Street,
forming an area of about three miles in circumference.&nbsp; They
could be purchased by the prisoners at the rate of five guineas
for small debts, eight guineas for the first hundred pounds of
debt, and about half that sum for every subsequent hundred.</p>
<p>The site of the prison is now occupied by workmen&rsquo;s
model dwellings named &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s Buildings,&rdquo;
divided, north and south, by Scovell&rsquo;s Road.</p>
<p>At the opposite side (east) of <i>Newington Causeway</i>,
which here commences, is <i>Union Road</i>, late <i>Horsemonger
</i><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span><i>Lane</i>; a short distance down which, on its south
side, is &ldquo;<span class="smcap">The Public Playground for
Children</span>,&rdquo; formerly the site of <b>Horsemonger Lane
Gaol</b>, erected at the back of the Surrey Sessions House.&nbsp;
Here the execution of the Mannings took place, November 13th,
1849, on which occasion Charles Dickens was present.&nbsp; The
same day he sent a notable letter to the <i>Times</i>, directing
general attention to the demoralising effect of such public
exhibitions; thus setting on foot an agitation which shortly
resulted in the adoption of our present private mode of carrying
out the last penalty of the law.&nbsp; After giving a forcible
and graphic picture of the night scenes enacted by the disorderly
crowd in waiting, the letter was thus continued:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When the sun rose brightly&mdash;as it
did&mdash;it gilded thousands upon thousands of upturned faces,
so inexpressibly odious in their brutal mirth or callousness,
that a man had cause to shrink from himself as fashioned in the
image of the devil.&nbsp; When the two miserable creatures who
attracted all this ghastly sight about them, were turned
quivering into the air, there was no more emotion, no more pity,
no more thought that two immortal souls had gone to judgment, no
more restraint in any of the previous obscenities, than if the
name of Christ had never been heard in this world, and there was
no belief among men but that they perished like the beasts.&nbsp;
I have seen, habitually, some of the worst sources of general
contamination and corruption in this country, and I think there
are not many phases of London life that could surprise me.&nbsp;
I am solemnly convinced that nothing that ingenuity could devise
to be done in this city, in the same compass of time, could work
such ruin as one public execution; and I stand astounded and
appalled by the wickedness it exhibits.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Mr. Chivery</b> resided with his family in <i>Horsemonger
Lane</i>, in close proximity to the old prison, and kept a
tobacconist&rsquo;s shop for the supply of his Marshalsea
customers and the general public of the neighbourhood&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A rural establishment one storey high,
which had the benefit of the air from the yards of Horsemonger
Lane Jail, and the advantage of a retired walk under the wall of
that pleasant establishment.&nbsp; The business was of too modest
a character to support a life-size Highlander, but it maintained
a little one on a bracket on the door-post, <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>who looked
like a fallen cherub that had found it necessary to take to a
kilt.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the little back-yard of the premises, &ldquo;Young
John&rdquo;&mdash;disappointed in love&mdash;was accustomed to
sit and meditate; taking cold among the &ldquo;tuneless
groves&rdquo; of the newly-washed family linen, and composing
suitable epitaphs to his own memory, in melancholy anticipation
of an early decease.</p>
<p>Proceeding along the Borough Road, we arrive in due course at
<b>St. George&rsquo;s Obelisk</b>, which stands at the
meeting-point of six roads.&nbsp; In the twelfth chapter of
&ldquo;David Copperfield&rdquo; we read of the Obelisk as the
place near to which the &ldquo;long-legged young man with a very
little empty donkey-cart&rdquo; was standing, whom David engaged
to take his box to the Dover coach-office for sixpence.&nbsp; And
we all remember the sad <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> of that
engagement, as previously mentioned.&nbsp; Near at hand, at the
top of Blackfriars Road, stands <b>The Surrey Theatre</b>, at
which <i>Fanny Dorrit</i> was engaged as a dancer, while her
Uncle Frederick played the clarionet in the orchestra.</p>
<p>Crossing over to the opposite thoroughfare of <i>Lambeth
Road</i>, the Rambler will find, at a short distance on the left,
the entrance to <b>Bethlehem Hospital</b>, familiarly known as
Bedlam.&nbsp; A reference to this asylum will be found in the
pages of &ldquo;The Uncommercial Traveller,&rdquo; where our
author implies the idea that the sane and insane are, at all
events, equal in their dreams&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Are not all of us outside this Hospital,
who dream more or less, in the condition of those inside it,
every night of our lives?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question may afford us matter for speculation as the route
is continued through Lambeth Road, at the end of which we turn to
the right, in the direction of the river.&nbsp; At the angle of
the roads, past the Lambeth Police Office, we reach
<b>Christchurch</b>, conspicuous for style and position, at <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>which the
Rev. Newman Hall some years since officiated.&nbsp; We may here
recall the criticism given by Dickens with reference to this
popular preacher in the book above referred to.&nbsp; See
&ldquo;<i>Two Views of a Cheap Theatre</i>,&rdquo; as contained
in &ldquo;The Uncommercial Traveller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We now come onwards by <i>Westminster Bridge Road</i>, passing
beneath the span of the London and South-Western Railway.&nbsp;
Near Westminster Bridge, on the left, is the old site of
<b>Astley&rsquo;s Theatre</b> (non-existent since 1896).&nbsp;
This establishment had cause to bless itself once a quarter, in
days gone by, when Christopher Nubbles, Barbara, and friends
patronised the performance.&nbsp; We may here remember the
occasion when Kit knocked a man over the head with his bundle of
oranges for &ldquo;scroudging his parent with unnecessary
violence;&rdquo; also the happy evening that followed, when
little Jacob first saw a play and learnt what oysters meant
(<i>vide</i> the &ldquo;Old Curiosity Shop&rdquo;).&nbsp; On the
site formerly occupied by this favourite place of entertainment,
there now stand five handsome houses and shops, Nos. 225 to 233
Westminster Bridge Road.</p>
<p>Past a few doors beyond these, above, on the same side, we
reach <b>Lambeth Palace Road</b>, turning by which we may walk
(or ride by tramcar) a short distance southward.&nbsp; Leaving on
the right the seven handsome buildings of <span class="smcap">St.
Thomas&rsquo;s Hospital</span>, we pass&mdash;on the
left&mdash;farther on, <span class="smcap">Lambeth Episcopal
Palace</span>, and cross the Thames by <span
class="smcap">Lambeth Suspension Bridge</span>.</p>
<p>On the Middlesex shore we come into <i>Millbank Street</i>,
and bestow a brief thought on <b>Poor</b>
&ldquo;<b>Martha</b>,&rdquo; following her in imagination as she
took her melancholy way southward in this same street, towards
the waste riverside locality, &ldquo;near the great blank
prison&rdquo; of Millbank, long since replaced by <i>Tate&rsquo;s
Gallery</i>.</p>
<p>Here it will be remembered that <i>David Copperfield</i> and
his trusty friend <i>Mr. Peggotty</i> saved the despairing girl
from a self-sought and miserable death.</p>
<p><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>At a
few minutes&rsquo; distance northward from the bridge, <i>Church
Street</i> will be found, leading (left) to <i>Smith
Square</i>.&nbsp; In this street lived <b>The Dolls&rsquo;
Dressmaker</b>, little <i>Jenny Wren</i>.&nbsp; The whimsical
description of the central church&mdash;<span class="smcap">St.
John the Evangelist&rsquo;s</span>&mdash;as given in the pages of
&ldquo;Our Mutual Friend,&rdquo; may be worth comparison with the
original&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In this region are a certain little street
called Church Street, and a certain little blind square called
Smith Square, in the centre of which last retreat is a very
hideous church, with four towers at the four corners, generally
resembling some petrified monster, frightful and gigantic, on its
back with its legs in the air.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The house in which Jenny and her father lived is stated to
have been one of the modest little houses which stand at the
point where the street gives into Smith Square.&nbsp; The Rambler
will observe four houses answering this description on the north
side of Church Street; No. 9 has been indicated as the humble
home in question, where &ldquo;<i>the person of the
house</i>&rdquo; and her &ldquo;<i>bad boy</i>&rdquo;
resided.&nbsp; Here, also, <i>Lizzie Hexam</i> lodged for some
time after the death of her father, during the days when her
uncertain lover, <i>Eugene Wrayburn</i>, was yet a bachelor.</p>
<p>We may now return to the main road and continue the northward
route by <i>Abingdon Street</i>, crossing <i>Old Palace
Yard</i>.&nbsp; A passing thought may here be given to Mr. John
Harmon, the <i>Julius Handford</i> of &ldquo;Our Mutual
Friend,&rdquo; who furnished the Police authorities with his
address&mdash;The Exchequer Coffee House, Palace Yard,
Westminster.&nbsp; Such a house of resort no longer exists in
this vicinity.</p>
<p>On the west side the Rambler passes the precincts of
<b>Westminster Abbey</b>, beneath whose &ldquo;high embowed
roof&rdquo; repose the sacred ashes of the illustrious
dead.&nbsp; To this venerable fane&mdash;the especial
resting-place of English literary genius&mdash;we will return
after our concluding ramble to the birthplace of our greatest
English novelist.</p>
<p>The onward road takes us past the <span class="smcap">Houses
of Parliament</span>, on the right, to <span
class="smcap">Parliament Street</span>, leading to Whitehall and
Charing <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>Cross.&nbsp; At a short distance up this thoroughfare is
Derby Street&mdash;the first turning on the right; on the north
corner of which there stood&mdash;until 1899&mdash;an old
public-house, &ldquo;<b>The Red Lion</b>&rdquo; (No. 48).&nbsp;
This place may be specially noted as the house at which <i>young
David Copperfield</i> gave his &ldquo;magnificent order&rdquo;
for a glass of the &ldquo;Genuine Stunning,&rdquo; and where the
landlord&rsquo;s wife gave him back the money and a kiss
besides.&nbsp; This was an actual experience in the boyhood of
Dickens, and is referred to in Mr. Forster&rsquo;s Biography,
where the house is indicated as above.&nbsp; It is now being
rebuilt and modernised.</p>
<p>Proceeding by Whitehall, and crossing to the opposite side of
the street, we shortly arrive at <b>The Horse Guards</b>, and may
take passing observation of the <span class="smcap">Old
Clock</span>&mdash;famed for its perfection of
time-keeping&mdash;by whose warning note <i>Mark Tapley</i>
regulated the period of the interview next referred to.&nbsp;
Passing through the arched passage beneath, we now attain the
eastern side of <b>St. James&rsquo;s Park</b>.&nbsp; This
locality will be remembered as the place of meeting between
<i>Mary Graham</i> and <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i>, previous to his
departure for America.&nbsp; As the young lady was escorted by
Mark in the early morning from a City hotel, we may be certain
that the interview must have taken place on this side of the
Park, doubtless near the principal gate of the promenade facing
the Horse Guards&rsquo; entrance.</p>
<p>Leaving the Park northward, by <i>Spring Gardens</i>, we come
into <i>Cockspur Street</i>, shortly leading (left) to <span
class="smcap">Pall Mall</span>.&nbsp; At the first corner of the
latter stands <b>Her Majesty&rsquo;s Theatre</b>.&nbsp; At this
establishment, as reconstructed during the early years of the
century, <i>Mrs. Nickleby</i> attended, by special invitation of
<i>Sir Mulberry Hawk</i>, Messrs. Pyke and Pluck assisting on
that notable occasion, when, by a prearranged coincidence, Kate
and the Wititterlys occupied the adjoining box.&mdash;<i>Vide</i>
&ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby,&rdquo; chapter 27.</p>
<p>This Opera House was burnt down 1789, and rebuilt the
following year.&nbsp; It was remodelled 1818, and again <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>destroyed by
fire, December 6, 1867.&nbsp; Being a second time rebuilt, it
was, for some seasons, closed since 1875.&nbsp; The present
theatre is of recent and splendid erection.</p>
<p>At this central position, from which we may readily take
departure for any point in London, the present Ramble will
terminate.&nbsp; To all those needing reparation of tissue, a
visit to Epitaux&rsquo;s Restaurant, near the Haymarket Theatre,
will be satisfactory.</p>

<p>Starting from the <i>Holborn Viaduct</i> or <i>Ludgate Hill
Station</i> of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway, we cross
the Thames and proceed <i>en route</i> for the Kentish
uplands.&nbsp; At ten minutes&rsquo; distance from the London
terminus, passing the Elephant and Castle and Walworth Road
Stations, we may observe (on the left) the back of <b>Emmanuel
Church</b>, as the train slackens speed for
<i>Camberwell</i>.&nbsp; This may be noted as the place where
<i>Mr. Wemmick</i> and <i>Miss Skiffins</i> were united in the
bonds of matrimony; <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>so we may here suitably recall the scene narrated in
&ldquo;Great Expectations,&rdquo; and the informal and unexpected
procedure adopted by Mr. W. on that occasion&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We went towards Camberwell Green, and when
we were thereabouts, Wemmick said suddenly, &lsquo;Halloa!&nbsp;
Here&rsquo;s a church!&rsquo;&nbsp; There was nothing very
surprising in that; but again I was rather surprised when he
said, as if he were animated by a brilliant idea,
&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go in!&rsquo;&nbsp; We went in and looked all
round.&nbsp; In the meantime Wemmick was diving into his coat
pockets, and getting something out of paper there.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Halloa!&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a couple
of pairs of gloves!&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s put &rsquo;em
on!&rsquo;&nbsp; As the gloves were white kid gloves, I now began
to have my strong suspicions.&nbsp; They were strengthened into
certainty, when I beheld the Aged enter at a side door, escorting
a lady.&nbsp; &lsquo;Halloa!&rsquo; said Wemmick.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s Miss Skiffins!&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s have a
wedding!&rsquo; . . .&nbsp; True to his notion of seeming to do
it all without preparation, I heard Wemmick say to himself, as he
took something out of his waistcoat pocket before the service
began, &lsquo;Halloa!&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a ring!&rsquo; . .
.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, Mr. Pip,&rsquo; said Wemmick triumphantly, as
we came out, &lsquo;let me ask you whether anybody would suppose
this to be a wedding party.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The route being continued past <i>Herne Hill Station</i>, the
train arrives at <b>Dulwich</b>, which we may recollect <i>en
passant</i> as being the locality of <b>Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s
retirement</b>, before the days of railway locomotion.&nbsp; The
house&mdash;a white, comfortable-looking residence&mdash;stands
(left) near the station, as we approach, corresponding in style
and position with its Pickwickian description.&nbsp; <i>Mr.
Tupman</i>, too, may have been met with in olden time, walking in
the public promenades or loitering in the Dulwich Picture
Gallery&mdash;&ldquo;with a youthful and jaunty
air&rdquo;&mdash;still in the enjoyment of single blessedness,
and the cynosure of the numerous elderly ladies of the
neighbourhood.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Snodgrass</i> and <i>Emily Wardle</i>, as we all know,
were married at <span class="smcap">Dulwich Church</span>, in
this vicinity; the wedding guests&mdash;including &ldquo;the poor
relations, who got there somehow&rdquo;&mdash;assembling at Mr.
Pickwick&rsquo;s new house on that interesting occasion; and we
may remember the general <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>verdict then unanimously given as to
the elegance, comfort, and suitability of our old friend&rsquo;s
suburban retreat&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nothing was to be heard but congratulations
and commendations.&nbsp; Everything was so beautiful!&nbsp; The
lawn in front, the garden behind, the miniature conservatory, the
dining-room, the drawing-room, the bedrooms, the smoking-room;
and, above all, the study&mdash;with its pictures and easy
chairs, and odd cabinets and queer tables, and nooks out of
number, with a large cheerful window opening upon a pleasant
lawn, and commanding a pretty landscape, just dotted here and
there with little houses, almost hidden by the trees.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Weller</b> and family&mdash;retainers
in the Pickwickian establishment&mdash;also flourished aforetime
in these arcadian groves, in faithful attendance on their
illustrious patron.</p>
<p>The journey being resumed, we pass onwards (Crystal Palace on
the right side of the railway) <i>vi&acirc; Penge</i> and
<i>Bromley</i>, and several country towns beyond&mdash;a pleasant
ride of about an hour&rsquo;s duration&mdash;arriving in due
course at <b>Sole Street Station</b> (30 miles from London),
about a mile south-west from the village of <b>Cobham</b>.&nbsp;
A pleasant walk of twenty minutes on the high road will lead the
wayfarer through Owlet to the pretty parish aforesaid; the rural
retreat&mdash;famous in the annals of Pickwickian
history&mdash;selected by <i>Mr. Tracy Tupman</i> for his
retirement from the world, after his disappointment at the hands
of Miss Rachael Wardle.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p84.jpg">
<img alt=
"The &ldquo;Leather Bottle&rdquo;, Cobham"

"The &ldquo;Leather Bottle&rdquo;, Cobham"
src="images/p84.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;<b>The Leather Bottle Inn</b>&rdquo;&mdash;where he was
found at dinner by his anxious friends&mdash;is described as
&ldquo;a clean and commodious village ale-house,&rdquo; and still
maintains its favourable repute.&nbsp; It stands opposite the
church at Cobham&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At Muggleton they procured a conveyance to
Rochester.&nbsp; By the time they reached the last-named place,
the violence of their grief had sufficiently abated to admit of
their making a very excellent early dinner; and having procured
the necessary information relative to the road, the three friends
set forward again in the afternoon to walk to Cobham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A delightful walk it was; for it was a pleasant
afternoon in June, and their way lay through a deep and shady
wood, cooled by the light wind which gently rustled the thick
foliage, and enlivened by the songs <a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>of the birds that perched upon the
boughs.&nbsp; The ivy and the moss crept in thick clusters over
the old trees, and the soft green turf overspread the ground like
a silken mat.&nbsp; They emerged upon an open park, with an
ancient hall, displaying the quaint and picturesque architecture
of Elizabeth&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; Long vistas of stately oaks and
elm-trees appeared on every side; large herds of deer were
cropping the fresh grass; and occasionally a startled hare
scoured along the ground with the speed of the shadows thrown by
the light clouds which swept across a sunny landscape like a
passing breath of summer.&nbsp; &lsquo;If this,&rsquo; said Mr.
Pickwick, looking about him, &lsquo;if this were the place to
which all who are troubled with our friend&rsquo;s complaint
came, I fancy their old attachment to this world would very soon
return.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I think so too,&rsquo; said Mr. Winkle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And really,&rsquo; added Mr. Pickwick, after
half-an-hour&rsquo;s walking had brought them to the village,
&lsquo;really, for a misanthrope&rsquo;s choice, this is one of
the prettiest and most desirable places of residence I ever met
with.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this opinion also both Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass
expressed their concurrence; and having been directed to the
Leather Bottle, a clean and commodious village ale-house, the
three travellers entered, and at once inquired for a gentleman of
the name of Tupman.&nbsp; The three friends entered a long,
low-roofed room, furnished with a large number of high-backed
leather-cushioned chairs, of fantastic shapes, and embellished
with a great variety of old portraits.&nbsp; At the upper end of
the room was a table, with a white cloth upon it, well covered
with a roast fowl, bacon, ale, and et ceteras; and at the table
sat Mr. Tupman, looking as unlike a man who had taken his leave
of the world as possible.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Resting here awhile, we may recall the &ldquo;immortal
discovery&rdquo; made by Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;which has been the
pride and boast of his friends and the envy of every antiquarian
in this or any other country&rdquo;&mdash;that famous stone found
by the chairman of the Pickwick Club himself; &ldquo;partially
buried in the ground in front of a cottage door,&rdquo; in this
same village of Cobham, on which &ldquo;the following fragment of
an inscription was clearly to be deciphered&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>Full
particulars are duly recorded in &ldquo;The Pickwick
Papers,&rdquo; chapter 11.&nbsp; We may also remember the
celebrated controversy in scientific and erudite circles, to
which this remarkable stone gave rise; Mr. Pickwick being
&ldquo;elected an honorary member of seventeen native and foreign
societies for the discovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The journey being resumed from Sole Street, we travel
<i>vi&acirc; Strood</i>, ten miles, to the important station
of</p>
<h3>CHATHAM.</h3>
<p>Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s description (taken from his note-book
sixty years since) is a fairly correct view of the general
appearance of Chatham at present:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The principal productions of these towns
appear to be soldiers, sailors, Jews, chalk, shrimps, officers,
and dockyardmen.&nbsp; The commodities chiefly exposed for sale
in the public streets are marine stores, hard-bake, apples,
flat-fish, and oysters.&nbsp; The streets present a lively and
animated appearance, occasioned chiefly by the conviviality of
the military.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this city five years of Dickens&rsquo;s boyhood were
passed.&nbsp; Mr. Dickens, senior, was appointed in 1816 to a
clerkship at the Naval Pay Office, in connection with the Royal
Dockyard, and the Dickens family here resided till little Charles
was nine years of age.</p>
<p>On arrival at the Chatham Station, we may enter the town on
the right from the railway exit (north side of the line), shortly
passing under an archway into <b>Railway
Street</b>&mdash;formerly Rome Lane&mdash;in which was once
situated the elementary school where the boy first attended, with
his sister Fanny.&nbsp; Revisiting Chatham in after years,
Dickens found that it had been pulled down</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ages before, but out of the distance of the
ages, arose, nevertheless, a not dim impression that it had been
over a dyer&rsquo;s shop; that he went up steps to it; that he
had frequently grazed his knees in doing so; and that in trying
to scrape the mud off a very unsteady little shoe, he generally
got his leg over the scraper.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the upper end of Railway Street we proceed (right) by the
<i>High Street</i>, and at a short distance (left) by <i>Fair
</i><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span><i>Row</i> to the <i>Brook</i>.&nbsp; Turning to the
left, we shall find, standing immediately beyond the corner, on
the west side, the old <b>Residence of the Dickens Family</b>,
No. 18, next door to <i>Providence Chapel</i>.&nbsp; The house is
a modest-looking dwelling of three storeys, with white-washed
plaster front as in former days, six steps leading up to the
front door, and a small garden before and behind.&nbsp; The
chapel previously referred to has been, in more recent years,
used for meetings of the Salvation Army, since becoming a
clothing factory.&nbsp; During the residence of the family at
Chatham, the minister of this place of worship was a <i>Mr.
William Giles</i>, who was also the schoolmaster of <b>Clover
Lane Academy</b>.&nbsp; For the last two years of Charles&rsquo;s
Chatham experience he was placed under the educational
supervision of this young Baptist minister, whose influence seems
to have been favourable to the development of his pupil&rsquo;s
youthful talents.</p>
<p>Regaining the High Street by <i>Fair Row</i>, and turning to
the left for a short distance onwards, we reach, on the right
hand of the street, past the Mitre Hotel, <b>Clover Street</b>,
on the south side of which (at the corner of Richard Street) the
Academy, with its playground behind, may still be seen.&nbsp;
Forster says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Charles had himself a not ungrateful sense
in after years, that this first of his masters, in his
little-cared-for childhood, had pronounced him to be a boy of
capacity; and when, about half-way through the publication of
Pickwick, his old teacher sent a silver snuff-box with admiring
inscription to &lsquo;the inimitable Boz,&rsquo; it reminded him
of praise far more precious obtained by him at his first
year&rsquo;s examination in the Clover Lane Academy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coming through Clover Street, and turning (right) into the
<i>New Road</i>, we shortly regain the neighbourhood of Chatham
Station, on the south side of which a road in the westward
direction leads to <b>Fort Pitt</b>, now the Chatham Military
Hospital.&nbsp; Pickwickians will remember that Fort Pitt was
indicated by Lieutenant Tappleton, the friend of the choleric
<i>Doctor </i><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span><i>Slammer</i>, as being in the vicinity of a field
where the quarrel between the doctor and Mr. Winkle could be
adjusted.&nbsp; This old field, and the contiguous land
surrounding the Fort, now form <b>The Recreation Ground</b> of
the City.&nbsp; Visitors may hence obtain an interesting and
comprehensive view of the town and neighbourhood.&nbsp; We are,
doubtless, all familiar with the happy termination of the affair
of honour above referred to; the unworthy Jingle being at the
bottom of the mischief.&nbsp; Full particulars of the dilemma may
be found in chapter 2 of &ldquo;The Pickwick Papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning to the New Road, the Rambler, passing <span
class="smcap">St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s Hospital</span> (founded in
the eleventh century) on the right, may proceed by <i>Star
Hill</i>, in the outskirts of Rochester.&nbsp; On the south side
(left) of the descent there may be noted <i>en passant</i> the
new building of the <span class="smcap">Rochester Conservative
Club</span>, which stands on the site of <b>The Old
Theatre</b>.&nbsp; Here the versatile Mr. Jingle and his
melancholic friend, &ldquo;elegantly designated Dismal
Jemmy,&rdquo; were engaged to perform &ldquo;in the piece that
the Officers of the Fifty-second&rdquo; got up, when Mr. Pickwick
commenced his travels, May 1827.</p>
<p>The theatre was demolished December 1884.</p>
<p>Continuing the route, we soon arrive at the central street of
the old City of</p>
<h3>ROCHESTER.</h3>
<p>This place will be interesting to readers of Dickens for its
several associations with his books, including
&ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; &ldquo;Great Expectations,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Seven Poor Travellers,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Mystery
of Edwin Drood,&rdquo; his latest and uncompleted work.&nbsp; In
chapter 3 of this last-mentioned tale is the following
description:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;An ancient city, Cloisterham, and no meet
dwelling-place for any one with hankerings after the noisy
world.&nbsp; A monotonous, silent city, deriving an earthly
flavour throughout, from its Cathedral crypt. . . .&nbsp; A
drowsy city, Cloisterham, whose inhabitants seem to suppose, with
an inconsistency more strange than rare, that all its changes lie
behind <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>it,
and that there are no more to come. . . .&nbsp; So silent are the
streets of Cloisterham (though prone to echo on the smallest
provocation), that of a summer day the sunblinds of its shops
scarce dare to flap in the south wind; while the sun-browned
tramps who pass along and stare, quicken their limp a little that
they may the sooner get beyond the confines of its oppressive
respectability.&nbsp; This is a feat not difficult of
achievement, seeing that the streets of Cloisterham city are
little more than one narrow street by which you get into it, and
get out of it; the rest being mostly disappointing yards with
pumps in them and no thoroughfare&mdash;exception made of the
Cathedral-close, and a paved Quaker settlement. . . .&nbsp; In a
word, a city of another and a bygone time is Cloisterham, with
its hoarse Cathedral bell, its hoarse rooks hovering about the
Cathedral tower, its hoarser and less distinct rooks in the
stalls far beneath.&nbsp; Fragments of old wall, saint&rsquo;s
chapel, chapter-house, convent, and monastery have got
incongruously or obstructively built into many of its houses and
gardens, much as kindred jumbled notions have become incorporated
into many of its citizens&rsquo; minds.&nbsp; All things in it
are of the past.&rdquo;</p>

<img alt=

"Eastgate House, Rochester"
src="images/p89s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Entering the busier part of the town by the Eastgate
thoroughfare, we may shortly observe, on the right, <b>Eastgate
House</b>, now occupied by the <span class="smcap">City of
Rochester Workmen&rsquo;s Club</span>.&nbsp; It is a fine old
Elizabethan building; a well-preserved specimen of the domestic
architecture of the sixteenth century.&nbsp; The building abuts
on the street, with a large courtyard and entrance at the side;
and a spacious garden is attached at the back of the house.&nbsp;
For more than fifty years (until about twenty years since) this
establishment flourished as a ladies&rsquo; boarding-school, and
is referred to in the pages of &ldquo;Edwin Drood&rdquo; as
<b>The Nuns&rsquo; House</b>, the seminary conducted by the
eminently respectable <i>Miss Twinkleton</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the midst of Cloisterham stands the
Nuns&rsquo; House; a venerable brick edifice, whose present
appellation is doubtless derived from the legend of its
conventual uses.&nbsp; On the trim gate enclosing its old
courtyard, is a resplendent brass plate flashing forth the
legend, &lsquo;Seminary for young Ladies.&nbsp; Miss
Twinkleton.&rsquo;&nbsp; The house-front is so old and worn, and
the brass plate is so shining and staring, that the general
result has reminded imaginative strangers of a battered old beau
with a large modern eye-glass stuck in his blind eye.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the opposite side of the High Street (Nos. 146 and 147)
stands <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span><b>Mr. Sapsea&rsquo;s House</b>.&nbsp; It will be
remembered that we are introduced to <i>Mr. Thomas Sapsea</i>,
auctioneer and Mayor of Cloisterham, in the 4th chapter of the
same book, as being &ldquo;the purest jackass&rdquo; in the town;
adopting, in his voice and style, the professional mannerism of
his superiors&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr. Sapsea &lsquo;dresses at&rsquo; the
Dean; has been bowed to for the Dean, in mistake; has even been
spoken to in the street as My Lord, under the impression that he
was the Bishop come down unexpectedly, without his
chaplain.&nbsp; Mr. Sapsea is very proud of this, and of his
voice, and of his style.&nbsp; He has even (in selling landed
property) tried the experiment of slightly intoning in his
pulpit, to make himself more like what he takes to be the genuine
ecclesiastical article.&nbsp; So, in ending a Sale by Public
Auction, Mr. Sapsea finishes off with an air of bestowing a
benediction on the assembled brokers, which leaves the real
Dean&mdash;a modest and worthy gentleman&mdash;far
behind.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much of the humorous element of the tale is connected with
this character.&nbsp; According to local tradition, Mr. S. is
supposed to be a combination of two well-known townsmen, formerly
resident in <i>Rochester</i>; a councilman who lived at the above
address, and an auctioneer, once mayor of the city, over whose
door the pulpit spoken of in &ldquo;Edwin Drood&rdquo; could have
been seen&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Over the doorway is a wooden effigy, about
half life-size, representing Mr. Sapsea&rsquo;s father, in a
curly wig and toga, in the act of selling.&nbsp; The chastity of
the idea, and the natural appearance of the little figure,
hammer, and pulpit, have been much admired.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both the aforesaid local prototypes have departed this life
some time since, and the premises have been occupied by others
(equally competent, but less pretentious) of that ilk.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>We now turn on the left into <i>Crow Lane</i>; at the further
end of which, on the south side, stands <b>Restoration House</b>,
another specimen of the Elizabethan style, in the present
occupation of Stephen T. Aveling, Esq.&nbsp; This residence is of
interest as being the <i>Satis House</i> of &ldquo;Great
Expectations,&rdquo; in which <i>Miss Havisham</i> lived.&nbsp;
We may recollect the circumstance of <i>Pip</i> being escorted in
<i>Mr. Pumblechook&rsquo;s</i> chaise-cart to this address,
&ldquo;to play&rdquo; <a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>for the diversion of Miss
Havisham.&nbsp; Here he first met <i>Estella</i>, who then
treated him with extreme contempt, but with whom he fell
desperately in love notwithstanding.&nbsp; Pip says, when
speaking of his departure from the house:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I set off on the four-mile walk to our
forge, pondering, as I went along, on all I had seen, and deeply
revolving that I was a common labouring-boy: that my hands were
coarse; that my boots were thick; that I had fallen into a
despicable habit of calling knaves Jacks; that I was much more
ignorant than I had considered myself last night, and generally
that I was in a low-lived bad way.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[<b>Joe Gargery&rsquo;s Forge</b> and wooden house were in the
little village of <i>Cooling</i>, six miles north of
Rochester.&nbsp; The greater part of the parish is marsh-land,
extending to the Thames.&nbsp; Mr. Forster recalls, in his
biography, the occasion when he and his friend stood on the spot;
Dickens saying that &ldquo;he meant to make it the scene of the
opening of his story&mdash;Cooling Castle ruins, and the desolate
church lying out among the marshes, seven miles from
Gadshill.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here it was that Pip met the convict
<i>Magwitch</i>&mdash;by secret appointment&mdash;and supplied
him with &ldquo;wittles&rdquo; and a file, thus materially
influencing his own future fortunes.]</p>
<p>Turning to the left, we reach the <i>Promenade and Recreation
Ground</i>, called &ldquo;The Vines,&rdquo; an open space of more
than three acres, formerly the vinery of the ancient
Priory.&nbsp; It is referred to in &ldquo;Edwin Drood,&rdquo;
chapter 14, as the <b>Monk&rsquo;s Vineyard</b>, in which, near a
wicket-gate in a corner, Edwin met the old woman from the
opium-smoking den in the East end of London, from whom he
received warning of a threatened danger.&nbsp; This is the last
occasion that we read of Edwin Drood previous to his mysterious
disappearance&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The woman&rsquo;s words are in the rising
wind, in the angry sky, in the troubled water, in the flickering
lights.&nbsp; There is some solemn echo of them even in the
Cathedral chime, which strikes a sudden surprise to his heart as
he turns in under the archway of the Gate house.&nbsp; And so he
goes up the postern stair.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Passing on the right the handsome residence of the <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>Head Master
of the Grammar School, we cross the Vines, and turn on the right
hand to <b>Minor Canon Row</b>, a terrace of seven red-brick
houses at the north end of <i>St. Margaret Street</i> and on the
south side of the Cathedral Close.&nbsp; This locality bears the
appellation, in the before-mentioned book, of <b>Minor Canon
Corner</b>, the residence of the <i>Rev. Septimus Crisparkle</i>
and his mother, the &ldquo;china shepherdess.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
chapter 6 we find the following pleasant reference to the
same:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Minor Canon Corner was a quiet place in the
shadow of the Cathedral, which the cawing of the rooks, the
echoing footsteps of rare passers, the sound of the Cathedral
bell, or the roll of the Cathedral organ, seemed to render more
quiet than absolute silence. . . .&nbsp; Red-brick walls
harmoniously toned down in colour by time, strong-rooted ivy,
latticed windows, panelled rooms, big oaken beams in little
places, and stone-walled gardens where annual fruit yet ripened
upon monkish trees, were the principal surroundings of pretty old
Mrs. Crisparkle and the Reverend Septimus as they sat at
breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Immediately north of this position stands the old <b>Cathedral
of Rochester</b>, with its &ldquo;well-known massive grey square
tower,&rdquo; in which, we may remember, the respected <i>Mr.
John Jasper</i> was engaged as Lay Precentor; with the reputation
of being devoted to his art, and &ldquo;having done such wonders
with the choir.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the interior, on the wall of the
south-west transept, is a quaint monument to the memory of
<i>Richard Watts</i>, a prominent townsman to whom further
reference will be made.&nbsp; Underneath this is placed a brass
memorial-tablet, inscribed&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Charles
Dickens</span>.&mdash;Born at Portsmouth, seventh of February
1812.&nbsp; Died at Gadshill Place, by Rochester, ninth of June
1870.&nbsp; Buried in Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; To connect his
memory with the scenes in which his earliest and his latest years
were passed, and with the associations of Rochester Cathedral and
its neighbourhood, which extended over all his life, this tablet,
with the sanction of the Dean and Chapter, is placed by his
executors.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The author&rsquo;s latest suggestive sketch, in association
with this ancient fane, may be here suitably recalled:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>&ldquo;A brilliant morning shines on the old city.&nbsp;
Its antiquities and ruins are surpassingly beautiful, with the
lusty ivy gleaming in the sun, and the rich trees waving in the
balmy air.&nbsp; Changes of glorious light from moving boughs,
songs of birds, scents from gardens, woods, and fields&mdash;or,
rather, from the one great garden of the whole cultivated island
in its yielding time&mdash;penetrate into the Cathedral, subdue
its earthy odour, and preach the Resurrection and the Life.&nbsp;
The cold stone tombs of centuries ago grow warm; and flecks of
brightness dart into the sternest marble corners of the building,
fluttering there like wings.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>The Crypts</b> below contain the &ldquo;buried magnates of
ancient time and high degree,&rdquo; with whom <b>Durdles</b>,
the stonemason, was on terms of intimate familiarity&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the demolition of impedimental fragments
of wall, buttress, and pavement he has seen strange sights. . .
.&nbsp; Thus he will say, &lsquo;Durdles come upon the old chap,
by striking right into the coffin with his pick.&nbsp; The old
chap gave Durdles a look with his open eyes, as much as to say,
Is your name Durdles?&nbsp; Why, my man, I&rsquo;ve been waiting
for you a Devil of a time!&rsquo; And then he turned to
powder.&nbsp; With a two-foot rule always in his pocket, and a
mason&rsquo;s hammer all but always in his hand, Durdles goes
continually sounding, and tapping all about and about the
Cathedral; and whenever he says to Tope, &lsquo;Tope,
here&rsquo;s another old &rsquo;un in here,&rsquo; Tope announces
it to the Dean as an established discovery.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is believed that the prototype of this character was an old
German working stonemason, who lived at Rochester many years
since.&nbsp; He employed himself by carving various grotesque
figures out of odd fragments of soft stone found in the Cathedral
crypt, which he begged for the purpose; and it is recollected
that he was accustomed to carry these articles of <i>vertu</i>
about the town, tied up in a coloured handkerchief; also that,
whenever he succeeded in effecting a sale, he immediately
celebrated the transaction by getting very tipsy.&nbsp; He lodged
at a public-house named &ldquo;The Fortune of War,&rdquo; now
known as &ldquo;<i>The Lifeboat</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chapter 12, headed &ldquo;A Night with Durdles,&rdquo;
contains a description of the ascent of the <b>Cathedral
Tower</b>, to the following effect:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They go up the winding staircase . . .
among the cobwebs and <a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>the dust.&nbsp; Twice or thrice they
emerge into level low-arched galleries, whence they can look down
into the moonlight nave. . .&nbsp; Anon they turn into narrower
and steeper staircases, and the night air begins to blow upon
them, and the chirp of some startled jackdaw or frightened rook
precedes the heavy beating of wings in a confined space, and the
beating down of dust and straws upon their heads.&nbsp; At last,
leaving their light behind a stair&mdash;for it blows fresh up
here&mdash;they look down on Cloisterham, fair to see in the
moonlight: its ruined habitations and sanctuaries of the dead, at
the tower&rsquo;s base: its moss-softened red-tiled roofs and
red-brick houses of the living, clustered beyond: its river
winding down from the mist on the horizon, as though that were
its source, and already heaving with a restless knowledge of its
approach towards the sea.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before leaving the Cathedral precincts, on the north side we
soon pass <b>St. Nicholas Church</b>, and may note its pleasant
little graveyard&mdash;&ldquo;where daisies blossom on the
verdant sod&rdquo;&mdash;lying near the old walls of the Castle
and its contiguous gardens.&nbsp; It is said that this is the
spot which Dickens himself would have preferred as his last
resting-place.</p>
<p>We now approach the High Street by <b>The College Gate</b>
(facing <i>Pump Lane</i>), an old gatehouse with archway, having
two exterior doors, standing angle-wise in the street, with a
small postern at the back of the gate.&nbsp; The house, now
occupied by the assistant verger, is a gabled wooden structure of
two storeys, built over the stone gateway beneath.&nbsp; Students
of Dickens will remember that this was the residence of <i>Mr.
Tope</i>, &ldquo;chief verger and showman&rdquo; of the
Cathedral, with whom lodged Mr. John Jasper, the uncle of Edwin
Drood.&nbsp; It is first referred to in the 2nd chapter of the
book: &ldquo;an old stone gatehouse crossing the Close, with an
arched thoroughfare passing beneath it,&rdquo; decorated by
&ldquo;pendant masses of ivy and creeper covering the
building&rsquo;s front.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here Mr. Jasper entertained
his nephew and his nephew&rsquo;s friend; and we also read of
<i>Mr. Grewgious</i> climbing &ldquo;the postern
stair.&rdquo;&nbsp; On this latter occasion the old lawyer called
on Mr. Jasper, visiting Cloisterham in preparation for their
formal release as trustees on Edwin&rsquo;s attaining his
majority.</p>
<p>Turning to the right, on the opposite side of the High <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>Street, we
soon reach a stone-fronted edifice, with small windows and three
gables, known as <b>The Poor Travellers&rsquo; House</b>.&nbsp;
This charity was established 1579, by a local philanthropist,
<span class="smcap">Richard Watts</span>, formerly citizen of
Rochester, who rose from a humble position to be Member of
Parliament for the City.&nbsp; He entertained Queen Elizabeth at
his mansion (in 1573), a white house situated near the Castle
gardens, and called <i>Satis House</i>.&nbsp; It will be
recollected that Dickens transferred this name to Restoration
House, situated in Crow Lane.&nbsp; It is said that the
appellation was bestowed on the mansion by the virgin queen
herself, in recognition of the &ldquo;satisfactory&rdquo;
entertainment afforded by her host.&nbsp; <i>Estella</i> gives
another explanation of the title: &ldquo;It meant, when it was
given, that whoever had this house could want nothing else.&nbsp;
They must have been easily satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Watts&rsquo;s Charity</b>, the Travellers&rsquo; Rest
aforesaid, is associated with the Christmas Number of
<i>Household Words</i> (1854), entitled &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">The Seven Poor Travellers</span>;&rdquo; in which
the inscription over the quaint old door is reproduced as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">RICHARD WATTS, ESQ.,<br
/>
by his will dated 22 August 1579,<br />
founded this charity<br />
for six poor travellers,<br />
Who not being Rogues, or Proctors<br />
may receive gratis for one night,<br />
Lodging, Entertainment,<br />
and four-pence each.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The entertainment herein specified comprises for each
traveller, a supper of half a pound of freshly-cooked meat, one
pound of bread, and a half-pint of beer, which is given in
addition to the stated fourpence payable in the morning.</p>
<p>[This gentleman&rsquo;s memory is also perpetuated in the
charitable annals of the district by a handsome pile of
buildings, in the Elizabethan style, on the Maidstone Road,
called <span class="smcap">Watts&rsquo;s
Almshouses</span>&mdash;with pleasure-grounds in <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>front,
affording accommodation for ten men and ten women, who also
receive twelve shillings each per week.&nbsp; The Institution is
superintended by a matron and governed by sixteen trustees.]</p>
<p>We are doubtless familiar with the Christmas Eve entertainment
here provided by the narrator of &ldquo;The Seven Poor
Travellers,&rdquo; as above:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It was settled that at nine o&rsquo;clock
that night a Turkey and a piece of Roast Beef should smoke upon
the board, and that I, faint and unworthy minister for once of
Master Richard Watts, should preside as the Christmas-supper host
of the six Poor Travellers.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And we must all have a vivid recollection of the processional
order of supply on that festive opportunity:&mdash;</p>
<table>

</table>
<p>After hearty discussion of the orthodox plum-pudding and
mince-pies which crowned the feast, the company drew round the
fire, and the &ldquo;brown beauty&rdquo; of the host&mdash;the
pitcher, carried first in the procession&mdash;was elevated to
the table.&nbsp; It proved to be &ldquo;a glorious jorum&rdquo;
of hot Wassail, prepared from the chairman&rsquo;s special and
private receipt, the materials of which, &ldquo;together with
their proportions and combinations,&rdquo; he declines to
impart.&nbsp; Glasses being filled therefrom, the toast of the
evening was duly and reverently honoured: &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Christmas</span>!&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Christmas Eve</span>, my friends; when the
Shepherds, who were poor travellers too, in their way, heard the
angels sing, &lsquo;On earth peace.&nbsp; Goodwill toward
men!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>The pen
of the &ldquo;Inimitable&rdquo; was never in more genial feather
than when inditing this Christmas story, the cheery and
sympathetic humour of which is not excelled even by the
&ldquo;Carol&rdquo; itself.</p>
<p>Another Dickensian association with this Rochester Charity may
be quoted in connection with <b>Miss Adelaide Procter</b>.&nbsp;
During &rsquo;54 this lady had been a valued contributor to
<i>Household Words</i>, under the assumed name of
&ldquo;Berwick,&rdquo; and some speculation arose in the
editorial department as to the real personality of the
writer.&nbsp; The <i>nom de plume</i> being, in course of time,
relinquished, and the secret told, Mr. Dickens sent a letter of
congratulation and appreciation to the young
authoress&mdash;dated December 17th, 1854&mdash;which thus
concluded: &ldquo;Pray accept the blessing and forgiveness of
Richard Watts, though I am afraid you come under <i>both his
conditions of exclusion</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Retracing the High Street route, we again pass the Gate-house
of the Cathedral Close, and come, immediately on the left, to the
noted <b>Bull Hotel</b>, a commodious establishment of ancient
and respectable repute, and the principal posting-house of the
town.&nbsp; This is the celebrated hostelry at which the
Pickwickians sojourned on the occasion of their first visit to
Rochester, per &ldquo;Commodore&rdquo; coach from London.&nbsp;
In the large assembly-room upstairs&mdash;&ldquo;a long room,
with crimson-covered benches, and wax candles in glass
chandeliers, with the musicians securely confined in an elevated
den&rdquo;&mdash;the memorable Ball took place, on the evening of
their arrival, which was attended by <i>Mr. Tupman</i> and his
seductive friend <i>Jingle</i>; the latter affording some
information as to the exclusive character of Rochester
society:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wait a minute,&rsquo; said the
stranger, &lsquo;fun presently&mdash;nobs not come
yet&mdash;queer place.&nbsp; Dockyard people of upper rank
don&rsquo;t know Dockyard people of lower rank.&nbsp; Dockyard
people of lower rank don&rsquo;t know small gentry&mdash;small
gentry don&rsquo;t know tradespeople&mdash;Commissioner
don&rsquo;t know anybody.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Mr. Jingle, on that fateful occasion, gave dire <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>offence to
Doctor Slammer, of the 97th Regiment, by making himself
obtrusively agreeable to the rich little widow, Mrs. Budger; and
we may remember how the Doctor, with his &ldquo;hitherto
bottled-up indignation effervescing from all parts of his
countenance in a perspiration of passion,&rdquo; insisted on a
hostile meeting.</p>
<p>The hotel has a frontage of about 90 feet, with wide pillared
gateway, and extensive stabling at the back.&nbsp; Proceeding
past the Guildhall on the right, towards the end of the street,
facing Rochester Bridge, we arrive at <b>The Crown Hotel</b>,
pleasantly situated at the corner of the Esplanade and High
Street, one side of the house facing the Medway; a white-brick
edifice lately rebuilt.&nbsp; It is referred to in chapter 18 of
&ldquo;Edwin Drood&rdquo; as &ldquo;<i>The Crozier</i>,&rdquo;
the orthodox hotel at which <i>Mr. Datchery</i> took up his
temporary abode, previous to settling in Cloisterham as &ldquo;a
single buffer&mdash;an idle dog who lived upon his
means.&rdquo;&nbsp; Other visitors to Rochester may
advantageously imitate Mr. Datchery&rsquo;s example, the position
and conduct of the house being alike excellent.</p>
<p>Round the corner to the left, commences <b>The Esplanade</b>,
extending under the castle walls, and along the bank of the river
for a considerable distance.&nbsp; This promenade is mentioned in
the 13th chapter of &ldquo;Edwin Drood,&rdquo; being the scene of
the last interview between Edwin and Rosa, when they mutually
agreed to cancel the irksome bond between them&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They walked on by the river.&nbsp; They
began to speak of their separate plans.&nbsp; He would quicken
his departure from England, and she would remain where she was,
at least as long as Helena remained.&nbsp; The poor dear girls
should have their disappointment broken to them gently, and, as
the first preliminary, Miss Twinkleton should be confided in by
Rosa, even in advance of the reappearance of Mr. Grewgious.&nbsp;
It should be made clear in all quarters that she and Edwin were
the best of friends.&nbsp; There had never been so serene an
understanding between them since they were first
affianced.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leaving Rochester by <b>The Bridge</b>, crossing the Medway,
we may bestow a passing thought on <i>Richard Doubledick</i> as
he came over the <a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>same, &ldquo;with half a shoe to his dusty feet,&rdquo;
in the year 1799, limping into the town of Chatham.&nbsp; (See
&ldquo;The Seven Poor Travellers,&rdquo; previously
mentioned.)</p>

</a></p>
<p>On the north side of the river, the Rambler enters the town of
<i>Strood</i>, and may proceed through the same, about two miles
on the Gravesend Road, to</p>
<h3>GADSHILL PLACE,</h3>
<p>the last residence of Charles Dickens.&nbsp; It is situated on
the left-hand side, nearly opposite the <i>Falstaff
Inn</i>.&nbsp; The house was purchased by him on the 14th of
March 1856, for &pound;1790; and he afterwards projected and
carried out many costly additions and improvements thereto.&nbsp;
On the first-floor landing is displayed an illuminated frame (the
work of Mr. Owen Jones), which reads as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">This House</span>, <span
class="smcap">Gadshill Place</span>, stands on the summit of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s Gadshill, ever memorable for its association
with Sir John Falstaff in his noble
fancy&mdash;&lsquo;<i>But</i>, <i>my lads</i>, <i>my lads</i>,
<i>to-morrow morning</i>, <i>by four o&rsquo;clock</i>, <i>early
at Gadshill</i>! <i>there are pilgrims going to Canterbury with
rich offerings</i>, <i>and traders riding to London with fat
purses</i>: <i>I have vizards for you all</i>; <i>you have horses
for yourselves</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this residence Dickens had fixed his choice in his boyish
days.&nbsp; It had always held a prominent place amid the
recollections connected with his childhood.&nbsp; Forster says
that &ldquo;upon first seeing it as he came from Chatham with his
father, and looking up at it with admiration, he had been
promised that he might live in it himself, or some such house,
when he came to be a man, if he would only work hard
enough.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is pleasant to record that this ambition
was gratified in after life, when the dream of his boyhood was
realised.</p>
<p>In the contiguous shrubbery was placed a <b>Swiss Chalet</b>,
presented to Dickens by his friend Mr. Fechter, which arrived
from Paris in ninety-four pieces, fitting like the joints of a
puzzle.&nbsp; Our author was fond of working in this chalet
during the summer months; and in it, much of the material of his
latest work was prepared.</p>
<p><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>In
sad association with Gadshill Place, we must refer to the
unexpected <b>Death of Charles Dickens</b>, which occurred here
on the 9th of June 1870.&nbsp; He had been feeling weary and
fatigued for some days previous to this date, but had
nevertheless continued to work with cheerfulness, writing in the
chalet, in preparation of the sixth number of &ldquo;Edwin
Drood.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the 8th of June, whilst at dinner, he was
suddenly attacked with apoplexy, and never spoke afterwards; and
on the evening of the following day&mdash;with one rolling tear
and one deep sigh&mdash;his gentle spirit soared beyond these
earthly shadows,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Into the Land of
the Great Departed,<br />
Into the Silent Land.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An interval being allowed for refreshments at the Falstaff
Inn, <i>&agrave; discr&eacute;tion</i>, we may resume the road
onwards to the nearest station of <span
class="smcap">Higham</span>&mdash;about a mile
distant&mdash;whence the South-Eastern Railway may be taken for
the homeward journey.&nbsp; At five miles&rsquo; distance we
reach <b>Gravesend</b>, which is situated at the foot of the
hills, extending for some two miles on the south side of the
Thames.&nbsp; This town is the boundary of the port of London, at
which many outward and homeward bound vessels on foreign service
receive or discharge their passengers and freight.&nbsp; As we
pass this station we may remember that in chapter 57 of
&ldquo;David Copperfield,&rdquo; Gravesend is referred to as the
starting-point of <b>Mr. Peggotty</b> and his niece, emigrating
to Australia, and accompanied by <i>Martha</i>, <i>Mrs.
Gummidge</i>, <i>and the Micawber family</i>.&nbsp; The parting
with his friends David describes as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We went over the side into our boat, and
lay at a little distance to see the ship wafted on her
course.&nbsp; It was then calm, radiant sunset.&nbsp; She lay
between us and the red light, and every taper line and spar was
visible against the glow.&nbsp; A sight at once so beautiful, so
mournful, and so hopeful, as the glorious ship lying still on the
flushed water, with all the life on board her crowded at the
bulwarks, and there clustering for a moment, bareheaded and
silent, I never saw.&nbsp; Silent, <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>only for a moment.&nbsp; As the
sails rose to the wind, and the ship began to move, there broke
from all the boats three resounding cheers, which those on board
took up and echoed back, and which were echoed and re-echoed . .
.&nbsp; Surrounded by the rosy light . . . they solemnly passed
away.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Continuing the homeward journey by South-Eastern Railway, the
Rambler will arrive in due course at the station of <span
class="smcap">Greenwich</span>, eighteen miles from
Gravesend.&nbsp; Here alighting, a short walk eastward, on the
south side of the line&mdash;through <i>London Street</i>,
turning right by end of <i>Church Street</i>&mdash;will lead us
to the entrance of <b>Greenwich Park</b>.&nbsp; This well-known
place of popular resort was referred to by Dickens in his first
contributions to the <i>Evening Chronicle</i>, 1835, which were
afterwards collected under the name of &ldquo;Sketches by
Boz.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sketch is entitled &ldquo;<i>Greenwich
Fair</i>,&rdquo; and gives descriptions of the doings in the park
at that festival, as holden aforetime in this locality&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The principal amusement is to drag young
ladies up the steep hill which leads to the Observatory, and then
drag them down again at the very top of their speed, greatly to
the derangement of their curls and bonnet-caps, and much to the
edification of lookers-on from below.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the Park entrance we may now proceed towards the river by
<i>Church Street</i>, on the left hand of which, past <i>London
Street</i>, stands the <b>Church of St. Alphege</b>, a handsome
edifice in classic style.&nbsp; The happy wedding of <i>Bella
Wilfer</i> and <i>John Rokesmith</i>, otherwise <i>Harmon</i>,
here took place, in the presence of a &ldquo;gruff and glum old
pensioner&rdquo; from the neighbouring hospital, with two wooden
legs.&nbsp; We may also recall the circumstance of Mr. and Mrs.
Boffin&rsquo;s attendance, that worthy couple being hid away near
the church organ.</p>
<p>Following the route northward, we may soon reach <i>King
William Street</i>, by the river side, in which is situated
<b>Quartermaine&rsquo;s Ship Tavern</b>.&nbsp; This is the place
where the &ldquo;lovely woman&rdquo; and her father once dined
together on the occasion of their &ldquo;innocent
elopement.&rdquo;&nbsp; (See &ldquo;Our <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>Mutual
Friend,&rdquo; chapter 8, Book 2.)&nbsp; It may be also
remembered as the hotel at which was celebrated the wedding
dinner of <i>Mr. and Mrs. Rokesmith</i> aforesaid, &ldquo;dear
little Pa&rdquo; being the honoured guest of that blissful
opportunity.&nbsp; We may here also recollect the dignified
bearing of the head waiter&mdash;The Archbishop of
Greenwich&mdash;&ldquo;a solemn gentleman in black clothes and a
white cravat, who looked much more like a clergyman than
<i>the</i> clergyman, and seemed to have mounted a great deal
higher in the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving <span class="smcap">Greenwich</span>, a short ride of
twenty minutes (six miles), following the course of the river,
will bring us to the <span class="smcap">Charing Cross
Terminus</span>, in central London.</p>

<p>The excursion proposed in Ramble VI. to Chatham, Rochester,
Gadshill, etc. (see page 82), could be advantageously extended to
include <span class="smcap">Canterbury</span> and <span
class="smcap">Dover</span>, for visiting the localities in these
towns associated with the history of David Copperfield.</p>
<p>Beyond <b>Chatham</b> the journey is continued on the <span
class="smcap">London</span>, <span class="smcap">Chatham and
Dover Railway</span>, by three minor stations to <span
class="smcap">Sittingbourne</span>, formerly a favourite
resting-place for pilgrims (as its name would seem to indicate)
<i>en route</i> for Canterbury; but the modern mode of travel
only now necessitates a halt of twenty minutes.&nbsp; Passing
<span class="smcap">Teynsham</span> and <span
class="smcap">Faversham</span>, the train proceeds by the
intermediate station of <span class="smcap">Selling</span>, to
the fair old city of</p>
<h3>CANTERBURY,</h3>
<p>pleasantly situated on the banks of the Stour.&nbsp; Seat of
the <a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>Primate of England, where, as Mr. Micawber writes,
&ldquo;the society may be described as a happy admixture of the
agricultural and the clerical.&rdquo;&nbsp; A quaint and quiet
cathedral town, redolent with fragrant memories of <i>Agnes
Wickfield</i>, fairest type of English womanhood&mdash;her
father, and friends.</p>
<p>Proceeding from the station towards the Cathedral, by <span
class="smcap">Castle Street</span>, we reach the old Roman road
of <span class="smcap">Watling Street</span> (extending from
Chester to Dover), at the south corner of which (right), and
facing <span class="smcap">St. Margaret Street</span>, stands the
&ldquo;<b>Queen&rsquo;s Head Inn</b>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is
&ldquo;the little hotel&rdquo; patronised by Mr. and Mrs.
Micawber on the occasion of their first visit to Canterbury, as
related in chapter 17 of &ldquo;David
Copperfield&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Somebody turns up.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It was a little inn where Mr. Micawber put
up, and he occupied a little room in it, partitioned off from the
commercial room, and strongly flavoured with tobacco smoke.&nbsp;
I think it was over the kitchen, because a warm greasy smell
appeared to come up through the chinks in the floor, and there
was a flabby perspiration on the walls.&nbsp; I know it was near
the bar, on account of the smell of spirits and jingling of
glasses.&nbsp; Here, recumbent on a small sofa, underneath a
picture of a race-horse, with her head close to the fire, and her
feet pushing the mustard off the dumb-waiter at the other end of
the room, was Mrs. Micawber, to whom Mr. Micawber entered first,
saying, &lsquo;My dear, allow me to introduce to you a pupil of
Dr. Strong&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be remembered that the amiable lady thus referred to,
here confidentially explained to David the reason of their visit
to this part of the country&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Micawber was induced to think,
on inquiry, that there might be an opening for a man of his
talent in the Medway Coal Trade.&nbsp; Then, as Mr. Micawber very
properly said, the first step to be taken clearly was to come and
see the Medway; which we came and saw.&nbsp; I say
&lsquo;we,&rsquo; Master Copperfield, &lsquo;for I never
will,&rsquo; said Mrs. Micawber with emotion, &lsquo;I never will
desert Mr. Micawber. . . .&nbsp; Being so near here, Mr. Micawber
was of opinion that it would be rash not to come on and see the
Cathedral&mdash;firstly, on account of its being so well worth
seeing, and our never having seen it; and, secondly, on account
of the great probability of something turning up in a cathedral
town.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We may also recollect the dinner and convivial evening <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>thereafter,
celebrated two days later at this address, when David attended as
the honoured guest of the occasion&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We had a beautiful little dinner.&nbsp;
Quite an elegant dish of fish; the kidney-end of a loin of veal,
roasted; fried sausage-meat; a partridge, and a pudding.&nbsp;
There was wine, and there was strong ale; and after dinner Mrs.
Micawber made us a bowl of hot punch with her own hands.&nbsp;
Mr. Micawber was uncommonly convivial.&nbsp; I never saw him such
good company.&nbsp; He made his face shine with the punch, so
that it looked as if it had been varnished all over.&nbsp; He got
cheerfully sentimental about the town, and proposed success to
it, observing that Mrs. Micawber and himself had been made
extremely snug and comfortable there, and that he never should
forget the agreeable hours they had passed in
Canterbury.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later on there is recorded in the Copperfield autobiography
(chapter 42) how David, accompanied by his aunt and
friends&mdash;Messrs. Dick and Traddles&mdash;sojourned for the
night at this same hotel.&nbsp; They had arrived at Canterbury by
the Dover Mail, as desired by Mr. Micawber, in readiness to
assist the next day at the memorable &ldquo;Explosion&rdquo;
which resulted in the final discomfiture of <i>Uriah Heep</i>,
&ldquo;the Forger and the Cheat&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At the hotel where Mr. Micawber had
requested us to await him, which we got into, with some trouble,
in the middle of the night, I found a letter, importing that he
would appear in the morning punctually at half-past nine.&nbsp;
After which, we went shivering at that uncomfortable hour to our
respective beds, through various close passages, which smelt as
if they had been steeped for ages in a solution of soup and
stables.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following the course of St. Margaret Street northward, and
passing (left) the old <span class="smcap">Church of St.
Margaret</span>&mdash;recently restored by Sir Gilbert
Scott&mdash;we soon arrive at the central main thoroughfare,
which here divides the town, extending from St. Dunstan&rsquo;s
Church (west) to the New Dover Road, leaving Canterbury on the
east.</p>
<p>Crossing the <span class="smcap">High Street</span>, and
continuing northward through the narrow thoroughfare of <span
class="smcap">Mercery Lane</span> (on the opposite
side)&mdash;once the resort of the many pilgrims who came
aforetime to worship at the shrine of <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>Thomas-&agrave;-Becket&mdash;we
enter the precincts of the Cathedral by <span
class="smcap">Christ Church Gate</span> (16th century).</p>
<p>Turning to the right within the Close, and passing the
secluded residences of several &ldquo;grave and reverend
seigniors,&rdquo; we may find, on the farther side,
<b>King&rsquo;s School</b>, an educational establishment of good
repute and old foundation, pleasantly and quietly situated.&nbsp;
The school is supervised by certain &ldquo;worthy and approved
good masters,&rdquo; successors to the amiable <span
class="smcap">Doctor Strong</span> and assistants, under whose
careful tutorship David Copper-field was educated after his
adoption by Miss Betsy Trotwood.&nbsp; In the commencement of
chapter 16 of his autobiography, David thus describes the
place:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Next morning, after breakfast, I entered on
school life again.&nbsp; I went, accompanied by Mr. Wickfield, to
the scene of my future studies&mdash;a grave building in a
courtyard, with a learned air about it that seemed very well
suited to the stray rooks and jackdaws who came down from the
Cathedral towers to walk with a clerkly bearing on the
grass-plot&mdash;and was introduced to my new master, Doctor
Strong.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Doctor Strong&rsquo;s Private Residence</b>&mdash;at which
&ldquo;some of the higher scholars boarded&rdquo;&mdash;is an
antiquated house, situated at the corner of <span
class="smcap">Lady&rsquo;s Green</span> (No. 1), at a short
distance eastward.&nbsp; Here David was a frequent visitor,
learning particulars of the Doctor&rsquo;s history, and becoming
intimate with the various personages therewith connected.&nbsp;
Pleasant reminiscences of the doings and sayings of <i>Mrs.
Markleham</i>&mdash;&ldquo;the Old Soldier&rdquo; (so called by
the boys &ldquo;on account of her generalship, and the skill with
which she marshalled great forces of relations against the
Doctor&rdquo;)&mdash;the tender associations which cluster round
the story of <i>Annie</i>, the good doctor&rsquo;s true-hearted
wife; with a casual recollection of the family
cousin&mdash;<i>Mr. Jack Maldon</i>&mdash;(no better than he
should be)&mdash;may combine to enhance the interest of a visit
to this old-fashioned but comfortable home.</p>
<p>Crossing the <span class="smcap">Lady&rsquo;s Green</span>
towards the gate of the ancient <span class="smcap">Augustinian
Monastery</span>, and proceeding onwards by <span
class="smcap">Monastery Street</span>, we may find at the end and
<a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>corner
of the street, on the left hand, a noteworthy antique-looking
house, partly incorporated with a second gate of the old
Monastery, at present the residence of a gentleman of the medical
profession.&nbsp; In bygone time this house was a point of
considerable attraction to David during his later school-days at
Canterbury, as being the home of &ldquo;<b>The Eldest Miss
Larkins</b>,&rdquo; his second love.&nbsp; In chapter 18, as we
may remember, is contained a very pleasant piece of natural
sketching, entitled &ldquo;A Retrospect,&rdquo; comprising,
<i>inter alia</i>, the story of his youthful passion.&nbsp; David
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I worship the eldest Miss Larkins.&nbsp;
The eldest Miss Larkins is not a little girl.&nbsp; She is a
tall, dark, black-eyed, fine figure of a woman.&nbsp; The eldest
Miss Larkins is not a chicken, for the youngest Miss Larkins is
not that, and the eldest must be three or four years older.&nbsp;
Perhaps the eldest Miss Larkins may be about thirty.&nbsp; My
passion for her is beyond all bounds. . . .&nbsp; Everything that
belongs to her, or is connected with her, is precious to
me.&nbsp; Mr. Larkins (a gruff old gentleman with a double chin,
and one of his eyes immovable in his head) is fraught with
interest to me. . . .&nbsp; I regularly take walks outside Mr.
Larkins&rsquo;s house in the evening, though it cuts me to the
heart to see the officers go in, or to hear them up in the
drawing-room, where the eldest Miss Larkins plays the harp.&nbsp;
I even walk, on two or three occasions, in a sickly spooney
manner, round and round the house after the family are gone to
bed, wondering which is the eldest Miss Larkins&rsquo;s chamber
(and pitching, I dare say now, on Mr. Larkins&rsquo;s instead),
wishing that a fire would burst out; that the assembled crowd
would stand appalled; that I, dashing through them with a ladder,
might rear it against her window, save her in my arms, go back
for something she had left behind, and perish in the
flames.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <b>Drawing-Room</b> here mentioned is situated above the
old Monastery Gate, between the two towers which stand on either
side.&nbsp; We may recollect it was here that David, having
received an invitation to a private ball given at the
Larkins&rsquo;s, enjoyed his first dance with &ldquo;his dear
divinity;&rdquo; afterwards being introduced to <i>Mr.
Chestle</i>, a hop-grower from the neighbourhood of Ashford,
&ldquo;a friend of the family,&rdquo; and&mdash;alas for
David!&mdash;the future husband of the eldest Miss
Larkins&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I waltz with the eldest Miss Larkins!&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t know where, among whom, or how long.&nbsp; I only
know that I swim about in space with a <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>blue angel,
in a state of blissful delirium. . . .&nbsp; I am lost in the
recollection of this delicious interview, and the waltz, when she
comes to me again, with a plain, elderly gentleman, who has been
playing whist all night, upon her arm, and says, &lsquo;Oh, here
is my bold friend!&nbsp; Mr. Chestle wants to know you, Mr.
Copperfield.&rsquo;&nbsp; I feel at once that he is a friend of
the family, and am much gratified. . . .&nbsp; I think I am in a
happy dream.&nbsp; I waltz again with the eldest Miss
Larkins.&nbsp; She says I waltz so well!&nbsp; I go home in a
state of unspeakable bliss, and waltz in imagination, all night
long, with my arm round the blue waist of my dear
divinity.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proceeding westward, we pass along the opposite roadway which
faces the house above referred to, by Church Street St. Paul, and
Burgate Street, to the Old Cathedral entrance.</p>
<p>As the Rambler returns, again traversing Mercery Lane, there
may be noted on the left&mdash;No. 14&mdash;a respectable
<b>Butcher&rsquo;s Shop</b>, now in the keeping of Mr.
Cornes.&nbsp; It is evident from its position, near Christ Church
Gate, that this was the establishment where flourished, in days
of yore, that obnoxious &ldquo;young butcher&rdquo; who was
&ldquo;the terror of the youth of Canterbury,&rdquo; and the
especial enemy of the pupils at King&rsquo;s School.&nbsp; In
chapter 18&mdash;&ldquo;A Retrospect&rdquo;&mdash;Copperfield
writes as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is a vague belief abroad that the
beef suet with which he anoints his hair gives him unnatural
strength, and that he is a match for a man.&nbsp; He is a
broad-faced, bull-necked young butcher, with rough red cheeks, an
ill-conditioned mind, and an injurious tongue.&nbsp; His main use
of this tongue is to disparage Dr. Strong&rsquo;s young
gentlemen.&nbsp; He says publicly that if they want anything
he&rsquo;ll give it &rsquo;em.&nbsp; He names individuals among
them (myself included) whom he could undertake to settle with one
hand, and the other tied behind him.&nbsp; He waylays the smaller
boys to punch their unprotected heads, and calls challenges after
me in the open streets.&nbsp; For these sufficient reasons I
resolve to fight the butcher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a summer evening, down in a green hollow, at the
corner of a wall.&nbsp; I meet the butcher by appointment.&nbsp;
I am attended by a select body of our boys; the butcher by two
other butchers, a young publican, and a sweep.&nbsp; The
preliminaries are adjusted, and the butcher and myself stand face
to face.&nbsp; In a moment the butcher lights ten thousand
candles out of my left eyebrow.&nbsp; In another moment I
don&rsquo;t know where the wall is, or where I am, or where
anybody is.&nbsp; I hardly know which is myself and which the
butcher; we are always in such a tangle and tussle, knocking
about upon the trodden grass.&nbsp; Sometimes <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>I see the
butcher, bloody but confident; sometimes I see nothing, but sit
gasping on my second&rsquo;s knee; sometimes I go in at the
butcher madly, and cut my knuckles open against his face, without
appearing to discompose him at all.&nbsp; At last I awake, very
queer about the head, as from a giddy sleep, and see the butcher
walking off, congratulated by the two other butchers and the
sweep and publican, and putting on his coat as he goes, from
which I augur justly that the victory is his.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But a few years afterwards David&mdash;&aelig;tat.
17&mdash;becomes a better match for his opponent; and we read in
the same chapter how&mdash;after his youthful disappointment
<i>in re</i> &ldquo;the eldest Miss Larkins&rdquo;&mdash;having
received new provocation from the butcher, he goes out to battle
a second time, and gloriously defeats him.</p>
<p>Turning again on the right into the main central thoroughfare,
we may find, on the south side, the <b>Fleur de Lys
Hotel</b>&mdash;34 High Street.&nbsp; A well-appointed and
respectable establishment, at which, in the time of
Copperfield&rsquo;s school-days, Mr. Dick was in the habit of
stopping every alternate Wednesday, arriving from Dover by the
stage-coach on his special fortnightly visits to David.&nbsp; We
read that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;These Wednesdays were the happiest days of
Mr. Dick&rsquo;s life; they were far from being the least happy
of mine.&nbsp; He soon became known to every boy in the school,
and though he never took an active part in any game but
kite-flying, was as deeply interested in all our sports as any
one among us.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the opposite (north) side of the road stands the
old-fashioned <b>George and Dragon Inn</b>&mdash;No. 18 High
Street.&nbsp; In the days of Copperfield, the London and Dover
Coach, passing <i>en route</i> through Canterbury, stopped here
for change of horses.&nbsp; At this inn, therefore, was the
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Coach Office</span>,&rdquo; referred
to in chapter 17 as being the place of arrival and departure of
Mr. Dick, as aforesaid.&nbsp; This London Coach is also mentioned
in the closing paragraph of the same chapter, David being on his
way to offer Micawber a soothing word of comfort in reply to a
dismal letter just received from that &ldquo;Beggared
Outcast&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>&ldquo;Halfway there, I met the London coach with Mr.
and Mrs. Micawber up behind; Mr. Micawber, the very picture of
tranquil enjoyment, smiling at Mrs. Micawber&rsquo;s
conversation, eating walnuts out of a paper bag, with a bottle
sticking out of his breast pocket.&nbsp; As they did not see me,
I thought it best, all things considered, not to see them.&nbsp;
So, with a great weight taken off my mind, I turned into a
by-street that was the nearest way to school, and felt, upon the
whole, relieved that they were gone, though I still liked them
very much, nevertheless.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turning on the right (northward) from High Street, by a short
intermediate road, the Rambler approaches <span
class="smcap">Palace Street</span>, on the east side of which,
near the western end of the Cathedral, stands the <b>Church of
St. Alphege</b>.&nbsp; This edifice was casually referred to by
the &ldquo;Old Soldier,&rdquo; <i>Mrs. Markleham</i>, as the
church where the marriage of her daughter Annie with the worthy
Dr. Strong was solemnised.&nbsp; The reference occurs, by way of
interruption on the part of Mrs. M., during a very touching
conference between the doctor and his wife, as related in
&ldquo;Copperfield,&rdquo; chapter 45&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Dick
fulfils my aunt&rsquo;s predictions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passing onwards through <span class="smcap">St. Peter&rsquo;s
Street</span> to <span class="smcap">Westgate Street</span>,
crossing the western branch of the river, we come by a turning on
the right to <span class="smcap">North Lane</span>, in which is
situated the former <b>Residence of Uriah Heep</b>.&nbsp; It is a
small two-storeyed house with plastered front, on the right side,
near the entrance of the lane&mdash;No. 65; the
&ldquo;&rsquo;umble dwelling&rdquo; to which David was introduced
as described in chapter 17 of his history&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We entered a low, old-fashioned room,
walked straight into from the street, and found there Mrs. Heep,
who was the dead image of Uriah, only short. . . .&nbsp; It was a
perfectly decent room, half parlour and half kitchen, but not at
all a snug room.&nbsp; The tea things were set upon the table,
and the kettle was boiling on the hob.&nbsp; There was a chest of
drawers with an escritoire top, for Uriah to read or write at of
an evening; there was Uriah&rsquo;s blue bag lying down and
vomiting papers; there was a company of Uriah&rsquo;s books
commanded by Mr. Tidd; there was a corner cupboard, and there
were the usual articles of furniture.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
remember that any individual object had a bare, pinched, spare
look, but I do remember that the whole place had.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>Returning to the main street, we pass the ancient <span
class="smcap">West Gate</span>&mdash;a fine specimen of medieval
architecture, built between two massive round towers, with
battlements and portcullis&mdash;and continue westward by <span
class="smcap">St. Dunstan Street</span>.&nbsp; At a short
distance onwards, on the south side of the thoroughfare, nearly
facing the approach to the <span
class="smcap">South-Eastern</span> Railway Station, there may be
observed&mdash;No. 71&mdash;an old picturesque timbered house,
with three projecting gables and antiquated windows.&nbsp; This
was the <b>Residence of Mr. Wickfield</b>, as described by David,
in chapter 15, when he was first taken to Canterbury by Miss
Betsy Trotwood&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At length we stopped before a very old
house, bulging out over the road; a house with long low lattice
windows bulging out still farther, and beams with carved heads on
the ends, bulging out too, so that I fancied the whole house was
leaning forward, trying to see who was passing on the narrow
pavement below.&nbsp; It was quite spotless in its
cleanliness.&nbsp; The old-fashioned brass knocker on the low
arched door, ornamented with carved garlands of fruit and
flowers, twinkled like a star; the two stone steps descending to
the door were as white as if they had been covered with fair
linen; and all the angles and corners and carvings and mouldings,
and quaint little panes of glass, and quainter little windows,
though as old as the hills, were as pure as any snow that ever
fell upon the hills.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This house does not answer in every respect to the full
description as contained in the book.&nbsp; The &ldquo;little
round tower that formed one side of the
house&rdquo;&mdash;containing Uriah Heep&rsquo;s circular
office&mdash;being wanting to complete; but we may readily
imagine that this existed, some sixty years&rsquo; since, at the
western side, in the space now occupied by some gates and a roof
of more modern erection.&nbsp; This residence must certainly be
located in the <i>main London road</i>, as David&mdash;referring,
at the close of chapter 15, as above, to his recent pedestrian
journey from the Metropolis to Dover&mdash;speaks of his
&ldquo;coming through that old city and passing that very house
he lived in, without knowing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Some friends resident at Canterbury have been disposed to
locate Mr. Wickfield&rsquo;s house at No. 15 <span
class="smcap">Burgate Street</span>, now in occupation of the
legal firm of Messrs. <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>Fielding and Plummer (names,
by-the-bye, which are used by Dickens in &ldquo;The Cricket on
the Hearth&rdquo;); but neither the house nor its position will
in any way correspond with Copperfield&rsquo;s description of the
same.]</p>

</a></p>
<p>Here then was the Home of <i>Agnes</i>&mdash;that finest
delineation of feminine portraiture ever conceived by our
author&mdash;the central figure of the many pure and beautiful
associations which entwine themselves with the chief interests of
this most charming tale.&nbsp; In view of the personal history
and character of its heroine, we may well understand
Thackeray&rsquo;s eulogium of his contemporary, as providing for
the delectation of his daughters &ldquo;the pure pages of David
Copperfield;&rdquo; and we can as readily appreciate the
preference of Charles Dickens himself, when he says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Of all my books I like this the best.&nbsp;
It will be easily believed that I am a fond parent to every child
of my fancy, and that no one can ever love that family as dearly
as I love them.&nbsp; But, like many fond parents, I have, in my
heart of hearts, a favourite child, and his name is David
Copperfield.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leaving <span class="smcap">Canterbury</span> by the direct
line of the <span class="smcap">London</span>, <span
class="smcap">Chatham And Dover Railway</span>, we are carried
onward through a pleasant country towards the south-east coast;
the white roads of the district indicating the abundant
chalkiness of the soil.&nbsp; In Copperfield&rsquo;s 13th
chapter, narrating the circumstances of his long tramp to Dover,
he says, &ldquo;From head to foot I was powdered almost as white
with chalk and dust as if I had come out of a
lime-kiln.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passing three minor stations, the train arrives at <span
class="smcap">Dover Priory</span>&mdash;about which more
anon&mdash;whence it proceeds through an intervening tunnel to
the town station, at the old port of</p>
<h3>DOVER.</h3>
<p>The town is of especial interest to readers of &ldquo;David
Copperfield,&rdquo; as containing on its suburban heights the
cottage residence of Miss Trotwood and Mr. Dick.</p>
<p>Proceeding eastward from the station, a short distance <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>along <span
class="smcap">Commercial Quay</span>; turning left, then right;
and walking onwards <i>vi&acirc;</i> <span
class="smcap">Snargate</span>, <span class="smcap">Bench</span>
and <span class="smcap">King Streets</span>, the Rambler may
reach the <b>Market Place</b>, centrally situated in the lower
part of the town, and may recall the circumstance of poor David
resting near at hand, on his arrival&mdash;a juvenile stranger in
a strange land&mdash;after a morning&rsquo;s fruitless inquiry as
to the whereabouts of his aunt.&nbsp; We read (in chapter 13) as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I inquired about my aunt among the boatmen
first, and received various answers.&nbsp; One said she lived in
the South Foreland light, and had singed her whiskers by doing
so; another, that she was made fast to the great buoy outside the
harbour, and could be only visited at half-tide; a third, that
she was locked up in Maidstone Jail for child stealing; a fourth,
that she was seen to mount a broom in the last high wind and make
direct for Calais.&nbsp; The fly-drivers among whom I inquired
were equally jocose and equally disrespectful; and the
shopkeepers, not liking my appearance, generally replied without
hearing what I had to say, that they had got nothing for
me.&nbsp; I felt more miserable and destitute than I had done at
any period of my running away.&nbsp; My money was all gone, I had
nothing left to dispose of; I was hungry, thirsty, and worn out,
and seemed as distant from my end as if I had remained in
London.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the junction of <span class="smcap">Church Street</span>
and <span class="smcap">Castle Street</span>, both leading to and
from the Market Place&mdash;at the northeast angle&mdash;there
may be noted the <b>Street Corner</b> at which David sat down,
considering the position of affairs, and where he received the
first practical intimation for the proper direction of his
search:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The morning had worn away in these
inquiries, and I was sitting on the step of an empty shop at a
street corner, near the Market-place, deliberating upon wandering
towards those other places which had been mentioned, when a
fly-driver, coming by with his carriage, dropped a
horsecloth.&nbsp; Something good-natured in the man&rsquo;s face,
as I handed it up, encouraged me to ask him if he could tell me
where Miss Trotwood lived. . . .&nbsp; &lsquo;I tell you
what,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you go up there,&rsquo;
pointing with his whip towards the heights, &lsquo;and keep right
on till you come to some houses facing the sea, I think
you&rsquo;ll hear of her.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leaving the Market Place from its north-west corner, and <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>keeping
somewhat to the left, the Rambler may ascend by <span
class="smcap">Cannon</span> and <span class="smcap">Biggin
Streets</span>, as indicated by the coachman&rsquo;s whip, to the
heights of <b>Priory Hill</b>, on which elevation, in the
neighbourhood of <span class="smcap">St. Martin&rsquo;s
Priory</span> and the <span class="smcap">Priory Farm</span>,
there may be found several semi-detached residences pleasantly
overlooking the &ldquo;silver streak&rdquo; and the intervening
town below.&nbsp; Here, in an eligible position, there may be
seen <b>Stanley Mount</b>, a villa residence of two storeys, with
bow windows and contiguous lawn.&nbsp; This house now replaces an
older one, which aforetime was the cottage at which the worthy
Miss Trotwood lived; the miniature lawn in front being the
&ldquo;patch of green&rdquo; over which that amiable lady
asserted private right of way; persistently maintaining it
against all comers in general, and the Dover donkey boys in
particular&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The one great outrage of her life,
demanding to be constantly avenged, was the passage of a donkey
over that immaculate spot.&nbsp; In whatever occupation she was
engaged, however interesting to her the conversation in which she
was taking part, a donkey turned the current of her ideas in a
moment, and she was upon him straight.&nbsp; Jugs of water and
watering-pots were kept in secret places, ready to be discharged
on the offending boys, sticks were laid in ambush behind the
door, sallies were made at all hours, and incessant war
prevailed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Midway between Railway Stations and Quay, there may be noted
<b>The King&rsquo;s Head Hotel</b>, as being the old Coaching
House at which the London Mail terminated its journey, and
referred to in &ldquo;The Tale of Two Cities&rdquo; by the name
of &ldquo;The Royal George.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here may be recalled the
interview related in chapter 4, which took place at this hotel
between <i>Mr. Lorry</i> and <i>Miss Manette</i>, and at which
the reader is first introduced to the eccentric <i>Miss
Pross</i>&mdash;&ldquo;dressed in some extraordinary
tight-fitting fashion&rdquo;; wearing on &ldquo;her head a most
wonderful bonnet, like a Grenadier measure (and a good measure
too) or a great Stilton cheese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning to London by South-Eastern Rail, the <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>Rambler
will pass, about half-way on the road, the picturesque village of
<b>Staplehurst</b>.&nbsp; Near this station it may be remembered
that, on June 9th, 1865, a sad disaster occurred to the train in
which Mr. Dickens was a traveller.&nbsp; The <i>Postscript</i> to
&ldquo;Our Mutual Friend&rdquo; contains the following
reference:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Boffin (in their manuscript
dress) were on the South-Eastern Railway with me, in a terribly
destructive accident.&nbsp; When I had done what I could to help
others, I climbed back into my carriage&mdash;nearly turned over
a viaduct, and caught aslant upon the turn&mdash;to extricate the
worthy couple.&nbsp; They were very much soiled, but otherwise
unhurt. . . .&nbsp; I remember with devout thankfulness that I
can never be much nearer parting company with my readers for ever
than I was then, until there shall be written against my life the
two words with which I have this day closed this book&mdash;The
End.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A very delightful country excursion may be made for visiting
the neighbourhood of <b>Henley-on-Thames</b>, of especial
interest to the readers of &ldquo;Our Mutual Friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be remembered that <i>Lizzie Hexam</i>, desirous of
avoiding the attentions of her (then) unworthy lover, <i>Mr.
Eugene Wrayburn</i>, left London secretly, with the assistance of
Riah&mdash;representative of the honourable firm of Messrs.
Pubsey and Co.; that, by his recommendation, she obtained a
situation at a <span class="smcap">Paper Mill</span> (then under
Jewish management), at some distance from the Metropolis, and
remained for a time undisturbed in her country employment; that,
thereafter, <i>Eugene Wrayburn</i> obtained her address by
bribing the drunken father of &ldquo;<i>Jenny Wren</i>,&rdquo; <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>the
dolls&rsquo; dressmaker, and so followed Lizzie to her retreat,
being in his turn watched and followed by the passionate and
jealous schoolmaster, <i>Bradley Headstone</i>, who attempted his
life on the river bank; that, near at hand, was the <span
class="smcap">Angler&rsquo;s Inn</span>, to which
Eugene&mdash;nearly dead&mdash;was carried by the heroic and
devoted Lizzie, who saved him from a watery grave, and where
&ldquo;effect was given to the dolls&rsquo; dressmaker&rsquo;s
discovery,&rdquo; one night, some weeks later, by their romantic
marriage, while it was yet doubtful whether the bridegroom would
survive; that the death of <i>Betty Higden</i> occurred
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">On the Borders of
Oxfordshire</span>,&rdquo; near the mill at which <i>Lizzie
Hexam</i> was engaged, Lizzie herself attending the last moments
of the dying woman, and accepting her last request; that in
accordance with such request poor Betty was decently interred in
a contiguous churchyard, the charges being defrayed by her own
hard earnings, specially saved for the purpose; and that, on this
occasion, the first meeting of Lizzie and <i>Miss Bella
Wilfer</i> took place, when a very interesting and touching
interview ensued, which greatly assisted Bella in confirmation of
a brave and righteous decision <i>in re</i> money <i>versus</i>
love.&nbsp; Also that, at no great distance from this locality,
was situated &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Plashwater Weir Mill
Lock</span>,&rdquo; where <i>Rogue Riderhood</i> did duty as
deputy lock-keeper, and where, at the last, he and <i>Bradley
Headstone</i> were drowned.</p>
<p>These localities are in the neighbourhood of <span
class="smcap">Henley</span>, and may be readily verified by the
intelligent Rambler, adopting the excursion by land and water, as
subjoined.</p>
<p>Leaving <span class="smcap">Paddington Terminus</span> of the
Great Western Railway, we pass <span class="smcap">Westbourne
Park Junction</span>, and the well-arranged grounds of <i>Kensal
Green Cemetery</i> (in which repose the mortal remains of Leigh
Hunt, Sidney Smith, John Leech, and Thackeray) on the right,
travelling westward by the suburban stations of <i>Acton</i>,
<i>Ealing</i>, and <i>Castle Hill</i>, and cross the Wharncliffe
Viaduct to <span class="smcap">Hanwell</span>.</p>
<p>To the left may be seen the handsome building of the <span
class="smcap">Middlesex Lunatic Asylum</span>. We next arrive at
<a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span><span
class="smcap">Southall</span>, and afterwards cross the Grand
Junction Canal to <span class="smcap">Hayes</span> and <span
class="smcap">West Drayton</span>.&nbsp; Our train now passes
from Middlesex to Buckinghamshire, and steams onwards in the
neighbourhood of <i>Langley Park</i>&mdash;seen on the
right.&nbsp; The tower of Langley Church may be observed on the
left, rising from the trees, as we speed forward to <span
class="smcap">Slough</span>, where we obtain a distant glimpse of
the Royal Castle of Windsor, two miles southward.</p>
<p>Resuming the journey we come, in four miles&rsquo; run, to the
pleasant village of <span class="smcap">Taplow</span>, on the
borders of the Thames (here dividing the counties of
Buckinghamshire and Berkshire), and within easy distance of
<i>Burnham Beeches</i>, a favourite picnic resort.&nbsp; The
train now crosses the river, next arriving at <span
class="smcap">Maidenhead</span>, a market town on the
Thames.&nbsp; On the right, observation may be taken of
Maidenhead Bridge, a noble erection of thirteen arches.&nbsp;
Thereafter we soon arrive at <span class="smcap">Twyford
Junction</span>, where we change (unless seated in a special
through carriage) for <b>Henley</b>, situated four miles
northward, and served by a branch line.&nbsp; The town itself is
very pleasantly situated on the Thames, with an old church and
handsome bridge, but is of special interest to Dickensian
students as containing the <span class="smcap">Inn</span> at
which <i>Mr. Eugene Wrayburn</i> found accommodation on the
occasion of his journey in pursuit of Lizzie Hexam.&nbsp; See
&ldquo;Our Mutual Friend,&rdquo; book 3, chapter 1, in which
Bradley Headstone, returning to Plashwater Weir, is described as
reporting the circumstance to the deputy lock-keeper&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lock ho!&nbsp; Lock.&rsquo;&nbsp; It
was a light night, and a barge coming down summoned him
(Riderhood) out of a long doze.&nbsp; In due course he had let
the barge through and was alone again, looking to the closing of
his gates, when Bradley Headstone appeared before him, standing
on the brink of the Lock.&nbsp; &lsquo;Halloa,&rsquo; said
Riderhood.&nbsp; &lsquo;Back a&rsquo;ready,
T&rsquo;otherest?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;He has put up for the night
at an Angler&rsquo;s Inn,&rsquo; was the fatigued and hoarse
reply.&nbsp; &lsquo;He goes on, up the river, at six in the
morning.&nbsp; I have come back for a couple of hours&rsquo;
rest.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>The Red Lion Inn</b> thus referred to is situated north of
Henley Bridge, on the west bank of the river, and is a <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>favourite
resort for disciples of Izaak Walton and boating men in
general.&nbsp; Here it was that Eugene Wrayburn&mdash;after the
murderous attack by the schoolmaster&mdash;was brought almost
lifeless by Lizzie, when rescued by her from the river, as
narrated in chapter 6&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;She ran the boat ashore, went into the
water, released him from the line, and by main strength lifted
him in her arms and laid him in the bottom of the boat.&nbsp; He
had fearful wounds upon him, and she bound them up with her dress
torn into strips.&nbsp; Else, supposing him to be still alive,
she foresaw that he must bleed to death before he could be landed
at his inn, which was the nearest place for succour. . . .&nbsp;
She rowed hard&mdash;rowed desperately, but never
wildly&mdash;and seldom removed her eyes from him in the bottom
of the boat.&nbsp; She had so laid him there as that she might
see his disfigured face; it was so much disfigured that his
mother might have covered it, but it was above and beyond
disfigurement in her eyes.&nbsp; The boat touched the edge of inn
lawn, sloping gently to the water.&nbsp; There were lights in the
windows, but there chanced to be no one out of doors.&nbsp; She
made the boat fast, and again by main strength took him up, and
never laid him down until she laid him down in the
house.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The landing-place and patch of inn lawn, above indicated, may
now be verified as belonging to the &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Red Lion</span>&rdquo; at Henley aforesaid.&nbsp;
The lawn is a favourite standpoint for spectators interested in
the <span class="smcap">Henley Royal Regatta</span>, which takes
place every year usually about the beginning of July.</p>
<p><b>The marriage of Eugene and Lizzie</b> took place at this
same inn some weeks later, while it was yet uncertain that Eugene
would recover; the <i>Rev. Frank Milvey</i> officiating at the
bedside, <i>Bella</i> and her husband, <i>Mr. Lightwood</i>,
<i>Mrs. Milvey</i>, and <i>Jenny Wren</i> being duly in
attendance&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They all stood round the bed, and Mr.
Milvey, opening his book, began the service, so rarely associated
with the shadow of death; so inseparable in the mind from a flush
of life and gaiety and health and hope and joy.&nbsp; Bella
thought how different from her own sunny little wedding, and
wept.&nbsp; Mrs. Milvey overflowed with pity, and wept too.&nbsp;
The dolls&rsquo; dressmaker, with her hands before her face, wept
in her golden bower.&nbsp; Reading in a low, clear voice, and
bending over Eugene, who kept his eyes upon him, Mr. Milvey did
his office with suitable simplicity.&nbsp; As the bridegroom
could not move his hand, they touched his fingers with the ring,
and so put it on the bride.&nbsp; When <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>the two
plighted their troth, she laid her hand on his, and kept it
there.&nbsp; When the ceremony was done, and all the rest
departed from the room, she drew her arm under his head, and laid
her own head down on the pillow by his side.&nbsp; &lsquo;Undraw
the curtains, my dear girl,&rsquo; said Eugene, after a while,
&lsquo;and let us see our wedding-day.&rsquo;&nbsp; The sun was
rising, and his first rays struck into the room, as she came back
and put her lips to his.&nbsp; &lsquo;I bless the day!&rsquo;
said Eugene.&nbsp; &lsquo;I bless the day!&rsquo; said
Lizzie.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[The clergyman and friends who assisted on this interesting
occasion as above, left London from <b>Waterloo
Station</b>.&nbsp; We may remember that Mrs. Rokesmith, escorted
by Mr. Lightwood, came into town by rail from Greenwich.&nbsp;
Thus they would change trains at <span class="smcap">Waterloo
Junction</span>, and adopt the <i>South-Western Route</i> as
being the more convenient, travelling to Reading, and driving
thence to Henley.&nbsp; It was at this terminus that Bradley
Headstone first heard (from Mr. Milvey) of the intended wedding,
and was so seriously upset by the news, that an attack of
epilepsy ensued in consequence.&nbsp; We thus read in chapter 11,
book 4, with reference to Bella and her escort:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;From Greenwich they started directly for
London, and in London they waited at a railway station until such
time as the Rev. Frank Milvey, and Margaretta, his wife, with
whom Mortimer Lightwood had been already in conference, should
come and join them. . . .&nbsp; Then the train rattled among the
house-tops, and among the ragged sides of houses, torn down to
make way for it, over the swarming streets, and under the
fruitful earth, until it shot across the river. . . .&nbsp; A
carriage ride succeeded near the solemn river. . . .&nbsp; They
drew near the chamber where Eugene lay.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is certainly descriptive of the <span
class="smcap">South-Western Railway</span>, and is <i>not</i>
applicable to the Great Western Route.]</p>
<p>For full particulars the reader is referred to chapter 11,
book 4.&nbsp; On the occasion of Bella Wilfer&rsquo;s <span
class="smcap">First Visit</span> to Henley, and the introduction
of the two girls to each other, as narrated in chapter 9, book 3
(in association with the burial of old Betty Higden), mention is
made of &ldquo;<i>the little inn</i>,&rdquo; at which
Bella&rsquo;s friends were then accommodated.&nbsp; This was
<i>not</i> the &ldquo;Red Lion,&rdquo; but, in all probability,
was <a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span><b>The Anchor Inn</b>, a small, but very comfortable
hostelry in <i>Friday Street</i>, near the river.&nbsp; Visitors
desiring to combine economy with homeliness, are recommended to
follow Miss Wilfer&rsquo;s lead in this regard, and commit
themselves to the hospitable care of the present landlord.</p>
<p><b>The Railway Station</b> at Henley is referred to in the
last-named chapter as being near at hand, when &ldquo;the Rev.
Frank and Mrs. Frank, and Sloppy, and Bella and the Secretary set
out to walk to it;&rdquo; the two last dropping behind, for a
little confidential conversation on the road.&nbsp; We read
that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The railway, at this point knowingly
shutting a green eye and opening a red one, they had to run for
it.&nbsp; As Bella could not run easily so wrapped up, the
Secretary had to help her.&nbsp; When she took her opposite place
in the carriage corner, the brightness in her face was so
charming to behold, that on her exclaiming, &lsquo;What beautiful
stars and what a glorious night!&rsquo; the Secretary said,
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; but seemed to prefer to see the night and the
stars in the light of her lovely little countenance, to looking
out of window.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A short walk of five minutes from the station, southward by
the riverside (west bank), will bring the Rambler to <b>The Tow
Path</b>, the scene of that memorable interview between Lizzie
and Eugene, recorded in chapter 6, book 4, as taking place
previous to the catastrophe by which Wrayburn nearly lost his
life.&nbsp; The path leads to <b>Marsh Mill</b>, about half a
mile from Henley; a large and important paper mill, now in the
occupation of Mr. Wells, situated near the weir, with its long
wooden bridge leading to the lock.&nbsp; This was the mill at
which Lizzie Hexam, secretly leaving London, found refuge and
occupation, on the recommendation of her old friend Mr. Riah, her
worthy employers being a firm of Hebrew nationality.&nbsp; We
first read of this mill in connection with the closing scenes of
<i>Betty Higden&rsquo;s</i> history, as narrated in chapter 8,
book 3, and headed &ldquo;The end of a long
journey&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There now arose in the darkness a great
building full of lighted windows.&nbsp; Smoke was issuing from a
high chimney in the rear of it, and there was the sound of a
water-wheel at the side.&nbsp; Between her <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>and the
building lay a piece of water, in which the lighted windows were
reflected, and on its nearest margin was a plantation of
trees.&nbsp; &lsquo;I humbly thank the Power and the
Glory,&rsquo; said Betty Higden, holding up her withered hands,
&lsquo;that I have come to my journey&rsquo;s
end!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>The Death of Betty</b> here occurred; as, sinking on the
ground, and supporting herself against a tree &ldquo;whence she
could see, beyond some intervening trees and branches, the
lighted windows,&rdquo; her strength gave way&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am safe here,&rsquo; was her last
benumbed thought.&nbsp; &lsquo;When I am found dead at the foot
of the Cross, it will be by some of my own sort; some of the
working people who work among the lights yonder.&nbsp; I cannot
see the lighted windows now, but they are there.&nbsp; I am
thankful for all!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have the satisfaction of reading that the poor
woman&rsquo;s hopes were realised, for <i>Lizzie Hexam</i>
returning from the mill, found her lying among the trees as
described, and tended her at the last, with helpful and loving
hands&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A look of thankfulness and triumph lights
the worn old face.&nbsp; The eyes, which have been darkly fixed
upon the sky, turn with meaning in them towards the compassionate
face from which the tears are dropping, and a smile is on the
aged lips as they ask, &lsquo;What is your name, my
dear?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;My name is Lizzie Hexam.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I must be sore disfigured.&nbsp; Are you afraid to kiss
me?&rsquo;&nbsp; The answer is, the ready pressure of her lips
upon the cold but smiling mouth.&nbsp; &lsquo;Bless ye!&nbsp; Now
lift me, my love.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lizzie Hexam very softly raised
the weather-stained grey head, and lifted her as high as
Heaven.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>The Burial</b>, as detailed in the following chapter, must
have taken place in the little churchyard of the contiguous
village of <span class="smcap">Shiplake</span> (about
three-quarters of a mile distant), the service being conducted by
the Rev. Frank Milvey, and attended by the Secretary and poor
<i>Sloppy</i> as mourners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<b>A cry for help</b>.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be
interesting to indicate the local sequence of events on that
memorable Saturday evening, when Bradley Headstone, impelled by
wild resentment and furious jealousy, did his best to murder his
more favoured rival, as described in chapter 6, book 4, under the
above heading.&nbsp; It will be remembered that, on the evening
in question, <a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span><b>Eugene Wrayburn</b> having forced an appointment
with Lizzie Hexam, met her on the path by the river, when a very
affecting farewell interview ensued.&nbsp; This interview
occurring on the towpath&mdash;tolerably secluded at and after
twilight&mdash;about halfway between Henley and Marsh (see
<i>Marcus Stone&rsquo;s</i> Illustration, &ldquo;The Parting by
the River&rdquo;), Eugene strolled slowly towards his inn, while
Lizzie walked sorrowfully, as a matter of course, in the opposite
direction.&nbsp; We read that, passing Bradley Headstone
(disguised as a bargeman)&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Eugene Wrayburn went the opposite way, with
his hands behind him, and his purpose in his thoughts.&nbsp; He
passed the sheep, and passed the gate, and came within hearing of
the village sounds, and came to the bridge.&nbsp; The inn where
he stayed, like the village and the mill, was not across the
river, but on that side of the stream on which he walked . . .
feeling out of humour for noise or company, he crossed the
bridge, and sauntered on: looking up at the stars as they seemed
one by one to be kindled in the sky, and looking down at the
river as the same stars seemed to be kindled deep in the
water.&nbsp; A landing-place overshadowed by a willow, and a
pleasant boat lying moored there among some stakes, caught his
eye as he passed along.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus it will be seen how Eugene, following the <i>west
bank</i> of the Thames to Henley, and thereafter crossing
<b>Henley Bridge</b>, pursued the course of his meditations past
the landing-place on the opposite side, walking onwards by the
towpath thence continued, in the direction of <span
class="smcap">Poplar Point</span>.</p>
<p><b>The Murderous Attack</b> upon him by Headstone, in the
darkening shades of nightfall, must have here occurred, not far
from the bridge, and opposite to the town, Wrayburn being thrown
into the river by his assailant, and so left for dead.</p>
<p><b>Lizzie Hexam</b>, endeavouring to regain composure, went
towards Marsh, and must have crossed by <b>The Lock Gates</b> to
the main road beyond, turning in the direction of Henley.&nbsp;
She thereafter walked slowly onwards in the neighbourhood of the
bridge at its eastern side, and thus unconsciously came again
near to, and following behind, her lover, on the</p>
<p><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span><b>Eastern Tow Path</b> beyond the bridge, as above
mentioned.&nbsp; Hereabouts, hearing &ldquo;the sound of blows, a
faint groan, and a fall into the river,&rdquo; she ran towards
the spot from which the sounds had come&mdash;not far distant, on
the riverside path, northward from the bridge.&nbsp; We are all
familiar with the story of Lizzie&rsquo;s heroic rescue of Eugene
from the river.&nbsp; Finding a boat on the north side of <span
class="smcap">Henley Bridge</span>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;She passed the scene of the
struggle&mdash;yonder it was&mdash;on her left, well over the
boat&rsquo;s stern&mdash;she passed on her right the end of the
village street (New Street) . . . looking as the boat drove,
everywhere, everywhere for the floating face.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finding and recovering the body, she rowed &ldquo;back against
the stream,&rdquo; landing at the lawn of the <span
class="smcap">Red Lion Inn</span> as previously described.</p>
<p>The Rambler may now take a short trip by boat down the river
six miles from Henley, for visiting <span class="smcap">The
Lock</span> where <i>Rogue Riderhood</i> acted for a time, as
deputy superintendent.</p>
<p>Leaving <span class="smcap">Henley</span>, we may note, on the
left, the mansion of <i>Fawley Court</i>, beyond which, passing
<span class="smcap">Regatta Island</span>, we arrive at <span
class="smcap">Greenlands</span>, in the occupation of the Right
Hon. W. H. Smith (not unknown in political and literary
circles).&nbsp; The house is pleasantly situated at the bend of
the river.&nbsp; We next arrive at <i>Hambledon Lock</i>, two
miles from Henley; thereafter reaching <span
class="smcap">Aston</span>, as we proceed down the stream to
<span class="smcap">Medmenham</span>, with its picturesque Abbey,
founded in the reign of King John, standing on the north
bank.&nbsp; Below Medmenham is <b>Hurley Lock</b>, which is our
present destination.&nbsp; It is contiguous to <span
class="smcap">New Lock Weir</span>, and to the village of <span
class="smcap">Hurley</span>, situated on the right bank of the
river.&nbsp; This is known to readers of &ldquo;Our Mutual
Friend&rdquo; as <b>Plashwater Weir Mill Lock</b>, at whose gates
<i>Riderhood</i>&mdash;whilom a &ldquo;waterside
character,&rdquo; the partner of <i>Gaffer
Hexam</i>&mdash;officiated as deputy lock-keeper.&nbsp; We are
introduced to him as not very wide-awake in this capacity, in
chapter 1, book 4&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Plashwater Weir Mill
Lock</span> looked tranquil and pretty on an evening in the
summer-time.&nbsp; A soft air stirred the leaves of the fresh
green trees, and passed like a smooth shadow over the river, and
like a smoother shadow over the yielding grass.&nbsp; The voice
of the falling water, like the voices of the sea and the wind,
was an outer memory to a contemplative listener; but not
particularly so to Mr. Riderhood, who sat on one of the blunt
wooden levers of his lock-gates, dozing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To this locality came Bradley Headstone, who, for sinister
reasons of his own, cultivated Riderhood&rsquo;s acquaintance,
making <b>The Lock House</b> a convenient place of call, as he
pursued Eugene Wrayburn in his quest, full details of which may
be found in chapters 1 and 7, book 6.&nbsp; Here also was enacted
the final scene of the tragedy, as narrated in chapter 15, book
4, when Bradley Headstone drowned himself and Riderhood in the
Lock&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Bradley had caught him round the
body.&nbsp; He seemed to be girdled with an iron ring.&nbsp; They
were on the brink of the Lock, about midway between the two sets
of gates. . . .&nbsp; &lsquo;Let go!&rsquo; said Riderhood.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Stop!&nbsp; What are you trying at?&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t
drown me.&nbsp; Ain&rsquo;t I told you that the man as has come
through drowning can never be drowned?&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t be
drowned.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I can be!&rsquo; returned Bradley,
in a desperate, clenched voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am resolved to
be.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll hold you living, and I&rsquo;ll hold you
dead.&nbsp; Come down!&rsquo;&nbsp; Riderhood went over into the
smooth pit, backward, and Bradley Headstone upon him.&nbsp; When
the two were found, lying under the ooze and scum behind one of
the rotting gates, Riderhood&rsquo;s hold had relaxed, probably
in falling, and his eyes were staring upward.&nbsp; But he was
girdled still with Bradley&rsquo;s iron ring, and the rivets of
the iron ring held tight.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By road, <span class="smcap">Hurley Lock</span> is but four
miles distant from Henley; a pedestrian, therefore, could make an
easy short cut, as against a rower up the stream; hence the
assurance given by the deputy lock-keeper to his impatient
visitor (see book 4, chapter 1):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ha, ha!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be afeerd,
T&rsquo;otherest,&rsquo; said Riderhood.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
T&rsquo;other&rsquo;s got to make way agin the stream, and he
takes it easy.&nbsp; You can soon come up with him.&nbsp; But
wot&rsquo;s the good of saying that to you!&nbsp; You know how
fur you could have outwalked him betwixt <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>anywheres
about where he lost the tide&mdash;say Richmond&mdash;and this,
if you had had a mind to it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Travelling homeward on the return to London, it may be
desirable to break the journey at <span
class="smcap">Slough</span>&mdash;eighteen miles from
Paddington&mdash;whence may be conveniently visited the rustic
village and cemetery of <b>Stoke Pogis</b>, about a mile and a
half northward from the station.&nbsp; The latter contains the
tomb of the poet Gray, and is the scene of his famous
&ldquo;Elegy in a Country Churchyard.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be
remembered that from this well-known poem <b>Mr. Micawber&rsquo;s
Quotation</b> was taken, as an appropriate conclusion to one of
his many friendly but grandiloquent epistles, confirming an
important appointment.&nbsp; In &ldquo;David Copperfield,&rdquo;
at the end of chapter 49, we read of Micawber&rsquo;s expressed
determination to unmask his &ldquo;foxey&rdquo; employer, and to
crush &ldquo;to undiscoverable atoms that transcendent and
immortal hypocrite and perjurer, Heep&rdquo;; and we may recall
his &ldquo;most secret and confidential letter,&rdquo; soon
afterwards received by David, as containing the following
reference:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The duty done, and act of reparation
performed, which can alone enable me to contemplate my fellow
mortal, I shall be known no more.&nbsp; I shall simply require to
be deposited in that place of universal resort, where</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Each in his narrow cell for ever
laid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">With the plain Inscription,<br />
<span class="smcap">Wilkins Micawber</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, as the evening shades prevail, &ldquo;near and nearer
drawn&rdquo; through &ldquo;the glimmering landscape,&rdquo; we
again approach the lights of London Town, with (it may be hoped)
pleasant reminiscences of the foregoing excursions.&nbsp; Should
the Rambler, like Mr. John Harmon on a similar occasion, be
accompanied by a friend, who perchance may be &ldquo;nearer and
dearer than all other,&rdquo; he may appropriately endorse <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span><b>John
Harmon&rsquo;s reflections</b> as he made the same journey under
blissful circumstances (see &ldquo;Our Mutual Friend,&rdquo; book
3, end of chapter 9)&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O, boofer lady, fascinating boofer
lady!&nbsp; If I were but legally executor of Johnny&rsquo;s
will.&nbsp; If I had but the right to pay your legacy and take
your receipt!&nbsp; Something to this purpose surely mingled with
the blast of the train as it cleared the stations, all knowingly
shutting up their green eyes and opening their red ones when they
prepared to let the boofer lady pass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A pleasant drive from London to Chigwell is described in
chapter 19 of &ldquo;Barnaby Rudge,&rdquo; and may be still taken
about twelve miles by road, starting from Whitechapel Church
<i>vi&acirc;</i> Mile-End and Bow, thence crossing the River Lea,
and proceeding, in the county of Essex, by way of
<i>Stratford</i>, <i>Leytonstone</i>, <i>Snaresbrook</i>, and
<i>Wilcox Green</i>.&nbsp; But time will be saved by adopting a
convenient train, leaving Liverpool Street Station (Great Eastern
Railway) for <i>Buckhurst Hill</i>&mdash;on the Ongar Branch
Line&mdash;in the neighbourhood of Epping Forest, a district
formerly preserved by the old monarchs of Merrie England for the
enjoyment of field sports and the pleasures of the chase.</p>
<p>From this point a country walk (under two miles), turning <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>eastward,
and to the left after crossing the long intervening bridge, will
lead in due course to the main road at Chigwell.&nbsp; Coming
into the village we pass, at the corner on the right, <b>Chigwell
Church</b>, surrounded by its quiet churchyard.&nbsp; This
locality will be remembered as having afforded a resting-place to
Barnaby and his mother after their visit to Mr. Haredale at
<i>The Warren</i> (chapter 25).&nbsp; &ldquo;In the churchyard
they sat down to take their frugal dinner&rdquo;&mdash;Grip, the
raven, being one of the party&mdash;&ldquo;walking up and down
when he had dined with an air of elderly complacency, which was
strongly suggestive of his having his hands under his coat tails,
and appearing to read the tombstones with a very critical
taste.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the other side of the main road, a very
little way onward (left), stands the old <b>King&rsquo;s Head
Inn</b>, the original &ldquo;local habitation,&rdquo; if not
&ldquo;the name,&rdquo; of the ancient hostelry so intimately
associated with the central and domestic interests of the
aforesaid historical novel, and known to us therein as <b>The
Maypole</b>, &ldquo;an old building with more gable ends than a
lazy man would care to count on a sunny day; its windows, old
diamond pane lattices; its floors sunken and uneven; its ceilings
blackened by the hand of time, and heavy with massive beams; with
its overhanging storeys, drowsy little panes of glass, and front
bulging out and projecting over the pathway.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>This description is appropriate to the house as it stands at
present, a fine old specimen of the timbered architecture of
bygone centuries; but it may be remarked that <span
class="smcap">The Illustration</span> drawn by Cattermole, which
forms the frontispiece in the recent editions of &ldquo;Barnaby
Rudge,&rdquo; is altogether beside the mark; for the designer has
furnished therein, an elaborate and ornate picture of the old inn
which does not correspond with fact, but rather remains in
evidence of the beauty and exuberance of his artistic
imagination.&nbsp; Here, then, we may recall the visit of Mr. and
Mrs. Varden, accompanied by their daughter, the charming Dolly,
&ldquo;the very pink and pattern of good looks, <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>in a smart
little cherry-coloured mantle, with a hood of the same drawn over
her head, and, upon the top of that hood, a little straw hat,
trimmed with cherry-coloured ribbons, and worn the merest trifle
on one side&mdash;just enough, in short, to make it the wickedest
and most provoking head-dress that ever malicious milliner
devised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the same connection <b>The</b> &ldquo;<b>Bar</b>&rdquo;
<b>of the old</b> &ldquo;<b>Maypole</b>,&rdquo; the preparation
for dinner, and the kitchen are thus described:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;All bars are snug places, but the
Maypole&rsquo;s was the very snuggest, cosiest, and completest
bar that ever the wit of man devised.&nbsp; Such amazing bottles
in old oaken pigeon-holes; such gleaming tankards dangling from
pegs at about the same inclination as thirsty men would hold them
to their lips; such sturdy little Dutch kegs ranged in rows on
shelves; so many lemons hanging in separate nets, and forming the
fragrant grove already mentioned in this chronicle, suggestive,
with goodly loaves of snowy sugar stowed away hard by, of punch,
idealised beyond all mortal knowledge; such closets, such
presses, such drawers full of pipes, such places for putting
things away in hollow window seats, all crammed to the throat
with eatables, drinkables, or savoury condiments; lastly, and to
crown all, as typical of the immense resources of the
establishment, and its defiances to all visitors to cut and come
again, such a stupendous cheese!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a poor heart that never rejoices&mdash;it must
have been the poorest, weakest, and most watery heart that ever
beat which would not have warmed towards the Maypole bar.&nbsp;
Mrs. Varden&rsquo;s did directly.&nbsp; She could no more have
reproached John Willet among those household gods, the kegs and
bottles, lemons, pipes, and cheese, than she could have stabbed
him with his own bright carving-knife.&nbsp; The order for dinner
too&mdash;it might have soothed a savage.&nbsp; &lsquo;A bit of
fish,&rsquo; said John to the cook, &lsquo;and some lamb chops
(breaded, with plenty of ketchup), and a good salad, and a roast
spring chicken, with a dish of sausages and mashed potatoes, or
something of that sort.&rsquo;&nbsp; Something of that
sort!&nbsp; The resources of these inns!&nbsp; To talk carelessly
about dishes which in themselves were a first-rate holiday kind
of dinner, suitable to one&rsquo;s wedding-day, as something of
that sort, meaning, if you can&rsquo;t get a spring chicken, any
other trifle in the way of poultry will do&mdash;such as a
peacock, perhaps!&nbsp; The kitchen, too, with its great broad
cavernous chimney; the kitchen, where nothing in the way of
cookery seemed impossible; where you could believe in anything to
eat they chose to tell you of.&nbsp; Mrs. Varden returned from
the contemplation of these wonders to the bar again, with a head
quite dizzy and bewildered.&nbsp; Her housekeeping capacity was
not large enough to comprehend <a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>them.&nbsp; She was obliged to go to
sleep.&nbsp; Waking was pain, in the midst of such
immensity.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>The Warren</b>, residence of Mr. Haredale and his niece, an
old red-brick house, standing in its own grounds, was situated
about a mile eastward from the Maypole, and was thence accessible
by a path across the fields, from the garden exit of the inn, to
its position on the border of Hainault Forest.&nbsp; (See final
paragraph of chapter 19, &ldquo;Barnaby Rudge.&rdquo;)&nbsp; From
many suggestions in the book, it occupied, in all probability,
the site of <i>Forest House</i>, not a great distance from
Chigwell Row; but of this no certainty exists.</p>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Chigwell to Ipswich</span>.&nbsp; It will
be best to return from <i>Buckhurst Hill</i> by rail to Stratford
or Liverpool Street, in order to travel by fast main line train,
to the good old town of Ipswich, our next destination.&nbsp; The
journey&mdash;<i>vi&acirc;</i> Chelmsford and
Colchester&mdash;will occupy about two hours, during which we may
recall the memorable occasion of Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s excursion
per coach from the &ldquo;Bull Inn,&rdquo; Whitechapel, to this
ancient capital of Suffolk, attended by the faithful Sam, Mr.
Weller, senior, driving, and beguiling the tediousness of the way
with conversation of considerable
interest&mdash;&ldquo;possessing the inestimable charm of
blending amusement with instruction.&rdquo;&nbsp; Full details
will be found on reference to the &ldquo;Pickwick Papers,&rdquo;
chapter 22, together with the account of Mr. P.&rsquo;s
introduction to his fellow-traveller, Mr. Peter Magnus, &ldquo;a
red-haired man, with an inquisitive nose and blue
spectacles.&rdquo;&nbsp; On arrival at the station at
<b>Ipswich</b>, the wayfarer, crossing by bridge over the
<i>Gipping</i> river, may proceed straight onwards through
<i>Princes Street</i> (five minutes) to <i>Tavern
Street</i>.&nbsp; Turning to the right, along this thoroughfare,
he will soon see the <b>Great White Horse Hotel</b>, on the left
side of Tavern Street.&nbsp; Tramcars from the station pass the
hotel; also omnibus meets all trains.&nbsp; Telegraphic
address&mdash;Pickwick, Ipswich.&nbsp; In the chapter before
referred to is contained the following description:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>&ldquo;In the main street of Ipswich, on the left-hand
side of the way, a short distance after you have passed through
the open space fronting the Town Hall, stands an inn, known far
and wide by the appellation of the Great White Horse, rendered
the more conspicuous by a stone statue of some rapacious animal
with flowing mane and tail, distinctly resembling an insane
cart-horse, which is elevated above the principal door.&nbsp; The
Great White Horse is famous in the neighbourhood in the same
degree as a prize ox, or county paper-chronicled turnip, or
unwieldy pig&mdash;for its enormous size.&nbsp; Never were such
labyrinths of uncarpeted passages, such clusters of mouldy,
ill-lighted rooms, such huge numbers of small dens for eating or
sleeping in beneath one roof, as are collected together within
the four walls of the Great White Horse at Ipswich.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>The Dickensian Rambler will well remember this hotel as the
scene of <b>Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s</b> &ldquo;<b>romantic</b>
<b>adventure</b> with a middle-aged lady in yellow
curl-papers,&rdquo; related <i>in extenso</i> in the same chapter
as above.&nbsp; Information as to the exact bedroom allotted to
Mr. Pickwick on the occasion of his visit to this place is,
unfortunately, not afforded by local tradition; but the apartment
occupied by &ldquo;Miss Witherfield,&rdquo; whose privacy Mr. P.
inadvertently, but so unhappily, invaded, is indicated to
visitors on the second floor&mdash;No. 36, according to recent
rearrangement of enumeration, formerly known as No. 6.</p>
<p>Poor Mr. Pickwick, on his escape from his awkward predicament,
was unable to find his own room, but was at last rescued from his
dilemma by his faithful servitor&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;After groping his way a few paces down the
passage, and, to his infinite alarm, stumbling over several pairs
of boots in so doing, Mr. Pickwick crouched into a little recess
in the wall, to wait for morning as philosophically as he
might.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was not destined, however, to undergo this
additional trial of patience; for he had not been long ensconced
in his present concealment when, to his unspeakable horror, a
man, bearing a light, appeared at the end of the passage.&nbsp;
His horror was suddenly converted into joy, however, when he
recognised the form of his faithful attendant.&nbsp; It was
indeed Mr. Samuel Weller, who after sitting up thus late, in
conversation with the Boots, who was sitting up for the mail, was
now about to retire to rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, suddenly
appearing before him, &lsquo;where&rsquo;s my bedroom?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>&ldquo;Mr. Weller stared at his master with the most
emphatic surprise; and it was not until the question had been
repeated three several times, that he turned round, and led the
way to the long-sought apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sam,&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, as he got into
bed.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have made one of the most extraordinary
mistakes to-night that were ever heard of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wery likely, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller
drily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But of this I am determined, Sam,&rsquo; said
Mr. Pickwick, &lsquo;that if I were to stop in this house for six
months, I would never trust myself about it alone
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the wery prudentest resolution as
you could come to, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Weller.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You rayther want somebody to look arter you, sir, wen your
judgment goes out a wisitin&rsquo;.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By way of <i>Upper Brook Street</i>, <i>Tacket Street</i>, and
<i>Orwell Place</i>, we come to <i>Fore Street</i>, <i>St.
Clement&rsquo;s</i> (a thoroughfare in which still remain several
old houses of the sixteenth century), and soon reach the
whereabouts of <b>St. Clement&rsquo;s Church</b>, towards which,
on the morning following the disasters of the night of their
arrival, Mr. Samuel Weller bent his steps, and</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;endeavoured to dissipate his melancholy by
strolling among its ancient precincts.&nbsp; He had loitered
about for some time, when he found himself in a retired
spot&mdash;a kind of courtyard of venerable
appearance&mdash;which he discovered had no other outlet than the
turning by which he had entered.&nbsp; He was about retracing his
steps, when he was suddenly transfixed to the spot by a sudden
appearance; and the mode and manner of this appearance we now
proceed to relate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Samuel Weller had been staring up at the old brick
houses now and then, in his deep abstraction, bestowing a wink
upon some healthy-looking servant girl as she drew up a blind, or
threw open a bedroom window, when the green gate at the bottom of
the yard opened, and a man having emerged therefrom, closed the
green gate very carefully after him, and walked briskly towards
the very spot where Mr. Weller was standing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This personage proved to be none other than <b>Mr. Job
Trotter</b>, whose black hair and mulberry suit were at once
recognised by Sam, though their owner did his best to evade
detection:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As the green gate was closed behind him,
and there was no other outlet but the one in front, however, he
was not long in perceiving that he must pass Mr. Samuel Weller to
get away.&nbsp; He therefore resumed his brisk pace, and
advanced, staring straight before him.&nbsp; <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>The most
extraordinary thing about the man was, that he was contorting his
face into the most fearful and astonishing grimaces that ever
were beheld.&nbsp; Nature&rsquo;s handiwork never was disguised
with such extraordinary artificial carving, as the man had
overlaid his countenance with in one moment.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>The Green Gate</b> thus alluded to may yet be seen in a
passage or court at the bottom of <i>Angel Lane</i> (leading to
Back Street).&nbsp; It is the last garden gate in the churchyard,
a short distance from Church Street.&nbsp; The same courtyard and
gate will be remembered as the official entrance to the
<b>Residence of George Nupkins</b>, <b>Esq.</b>, the Worshipful
Mayor of Ipswich, before whom the Pickwickian party were
arraigned, in charge of the redoubtable chief constable of the
town.&nbsp; We read in chapter 25 as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr. Weller&rsquo;s anger quickly gave way
to curiosity when the procession turned down the identical
courtyard in which he had met with the runaway Job Trotter; and
curiosity was exchanged for a feeling of the most gleeful
astonishment, when the all-important Mr. Grummer, commanding the
sedan-bearers to halt, advanced with dignified and portentous
steps to the very green gate from which Job Trotter had emerged,
and gave a mighty pull at the bell-handle which hung at the side
thereof.&nbsp; The ring was answered by a very smart and
pretty-faced servant-girl, who, after holding up her hands in
astonishment at the rebellious appearance of the prisoners, and
the impassioned language of Mr. Pickwick, summoned Mr.
Muzzle.&nbsp; Mr. Muzzle opened one-half of the carriage gate to
admit the sedan, the captured ones, and the specials, and
immediately slammed it in the faces of the mob. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the foot of a flight of steps, leading to the house
door, which was guarded on either side by an American aloe in a
green tub, the sedan-chair stopped.&nbsp; Mr. Pickwick and his
friends were conducted into the hall, whence, having been
previously announced by Muzzle, and ordered in by Mr. Nupkins,
they were ushered into the worshipful presence of that
public-spirited officer.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And we all recollect the resulting <i>expos&eacute;</i> of the
designs of Mr. Alfred Jingle (<i>alias</i> Captain Fitzmarshall),
and the return by Mr. Weller of &ldquo;Job Trotter&rsquo;s
shuttlecock as heavily as it came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It should also be not forgotten that it was at this house Mr.
Weller met with his lady-elect, <b>Mary</b>, <b>the Pretty
Housemaid</b> (afterwards maid to Mrs. <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>Winkle),
and that here the first passage of first love occurred between
them.&nbsp; For the pleasant narration of the episode, reference
should be made to the conclusion of the foregoing
chapter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Now, there was nobody in the kitchen but
the pretty housemaid; and as Sam&rsquo;s hat was mislaid, he had
to look for it, and the pretty housemaid lighted him.&nbsp; They
had to look all over the place for the hat.&nbsp; The pretty
housemaid, in her anxiety to find it, went down on her knees, and
turned over all the things that were heaped together in a little
corner by the door.&nbsp; It was an awkward corner.&nbsp; You
couldn&rsquo;t get at it without shutting the door first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here it is,&rsquo; said the pretty
housemaid.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is it, ain&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let me look,&rsquo; said Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pretty housemaid had stood the candle on the floor;
as it gave a very dim light, Sam was obliged to go down on his
knees before he could see whether it really was his own hat or
not.&nbsp; It was a remarkably small corner, and so&mdash;it was
nobody&rsquo;s fault but the man&rsquo;s who built the
house&mdash;Sam and the pretty housemaid were necessarily very
close together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, this is it,&rsquo; said Sam.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Good-bye!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good-bye!&rsquo; said the pretty housemaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good-bye!&rsquo; said Sam; and as he said it, he
dropped the hat that had cost so much trouble in looking for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How awkward you are,&rsquo; said the pretty
housemaid.&nbsp; &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll lose it again, if you
don&rsquo;t take care.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, just to prevent his losing it again, she put it on
for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether it was that the pretty housemaid&rsquo;s face
looked prettier still, when it was raised towards Sam&rsquo;s, or
whether it was the accidental consequence of their being so near
to each other, is matter of uncertainty to this day; but Sam
kissed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say that you did that on
purpose,&rsquo; said the pretty housemaid, blushing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t then,&rsquo; said Sam;
&lsquo;but I will now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he kissed her again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sam!&rsquo; said Mr. Pickwick, calling over the
banisters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Coming, sir,&rsquo; replied Sam, running
upstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How long you have been!&rsquo; said Mr.
Pickwick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There was something behind the door, sir, which
perwented our getting it open, for ever so long, sir,&rsquo;
replied Sam.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Resuming the journey onwards by rail from Ipswich, the route
is continued <i>vi&acirc; Saxmundham Junction</i>,
<i>Halesworth</i>, and <i>Beccles</i>, to the South Town Station
at <a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span><b>Great Yarmouth</b>, a well-known and favourite
seaside resort, of much interest to the Dickensian Rambler, as
being intimately associated with the personal history and
experience of David Copperfield.&nbsp; Visitors are recommended,
for reasons hereafter to be seen, to select as their place of
sojourn either the &ldquo;<i>Star Hotel</i>&rdquo; on the Hall
Quay, or the &ldquo;<i>Angel</i>,&rdquo; near the
market-place.&nbsp; Any thoroughfare leading eastward from either
of these will conduct to the <i>Marine Parade</i>, in full view
of the German Ocean.</p>
<p>Towards the southern end of this sea frontage of the town,
there may be localised the spot where once stood the <b>Home of
Little Emily</b>, &ldquo;a black barge or some other kind of
superannuated boat, high and dry on the ground, with an iron
funnel sticking out of it for a chimney.&nbsp; There was a
delightful door cut in the side; it was roofed in, and there were
little windows in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The position of this old boat-house, as belonging to
Dan&rsquo;l Peggotty, was at the upper extremity of the <i>South
Denes</i>, a flat and grassy expanse&mdash;beyond the
<i>Wellington Pier</i> and <i>South Battery</i>&mdash;in the
neighbourhood of the <i>Nelson Column</i>, facing the sea.</p>
<p>In chapter 22 we find a reference to the South Town ferry,
crossing the Yare, &ldquo;to a flat between the river and the
sea, Mr. Peggotty&rsquo;s house being on that waste place, and
not a hundred yards out of the track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[There is a small wooden erection, more than a mile and a half
distant, on the sea-front near <i>Gorleston
Pier</i>&mdash;between two well-built houses&mdash;assuming the
name of <i>Peggotty&rsquo;s Hut</i>; but this is an evident
absurdity and misnomer.]</p>
<p>Here, then, we may recall the many interests and incidents
connected with the experiences of the Peggotty family, and the
sorrowful history of Little Emily, notably the fateful occasion
of <span class="smcap">Steerforth&rsquo;s First Visit</span>,
concerning which David records in chapter 21 of his
autobiography, to the following effect:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Em&rsquo;ly, indeed, said little all the
evening; but she looked, and listened, and her face got animated,
and she was charming.&nbsp; Steerforth told a story of a dismal
shipwreck (which arose out of his talk with Mr. <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>Peggotty),
as if he saw it all before him&mdash;and little
Em&rsquo;ly&rsquo;s eyes were fastened on him all the time, as if
she saw it too.&nbsp; He told us a merry adventure of his own, as
a relief to that, with as much gaiety as if the narrative were as
fresh to him as it was to us&mdash;and little Em&rsquo;ly laughed
until the boat rang with the musical sounds, and we all laughed
(Steerforth too), in irresistible sympathy with what was so
pleasant and lighthearted.&nbsp; He got Mr. Peggotty to sing, or
rather to roar, &lsquo;When the stormy winds do blow, do blow, do
blow;&rsquo; and he sang a sailor&rsquo;s song himself, so
pathetically and beautifully, that I could have almost fancied
that the real wind creeping sorrowfully round the house, and
murmuring low through our unbroken silence, was there to
listen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus commenced the sad story of the poor girl&rsquo;s
fascination and subsequent flight with Steerforth, never more to
return to the old home.&nbsp; In this connection we may recall
the graphic and powerful description of the great <b>Storm at
Yarmouth</b>, as contained in chapter 55, when Ham met his fate
in the gallant attempt to rescue the last survivor of a wrecked
and perishing crew, Steerforth himself:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They drew him to my very
feet&mdash;insensible&mdash;dead.&nbsp; He was carried to the
nearest house; and, no one preventing me now, I remained near
him, busy, while every means of restoration was tried; but he had
been beaten to death by the great wave, and his generous heart
was stilled for ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I sat beside the bed, when hope was abandoned and
all was done, a fisherman, who had known me when Emily and I were
children, and ever since, whispered my name at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rsquo; said he, with tears starting to his
weather-beaten face, which, with his trembling lips, was ashy
pale, &lsquo;will you come over yonder?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old remembrance that had been recalled to me was in
his look.&nbsp; I asked him, terror-stricken, leaning on the arm
he held out to support me&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Has a body come ashore?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do I know it?&rsquo; I asked then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He answered nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he led me to the shore.&nbsp; And on that part of
it where she and I had looked for shells, two children&mdash;on
that part of it where some lighter fragments of the old boat,
blown down last night, had been scattered by the wind&mdash;among
the ruins of the home he had wronged&mdash;I saw him lying with
his head upon his arm, as I had often seen him lie at
school.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>In
the days of Copperfield, <b>Two Coaches</b> ran between Great
Yarmouth and London&mdash;&ldquo;The Blue&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Royal Mail.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the occasion of David&rsquo;s first
journey to his school at Blackheath, he travelled by the former
of these, from <b>The Angel Hotel</b>, in the Market Place.&nbsp;
We may here recall his dinner of chops in the coffee-room, at
which the &ldquo;friendly waiter&rdquo; assisted, helping himself
to the lion&rsquo;s share.</p>
<p>In chapter 5 of his History, David relates the attendant
circumstances of this, his second visit to Yarmouth; and how,
starting as above from the hotel, his dinner&mdash;ordered and
paid for in advance&mdash;was mainly consumed by proxy, ale
included.&nbsp; We read that the waiter, &ldquo;a twinkling-eyed,
pimple-faced man, with his hair standing upright all over his
head,&rdquo; invited himself to the meal:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He took a chop by the bone in one hand, and
a potato in the other, and ate away with a very good appetite, to
my extreme satisfaction.&nbsp; He afterwards took another chop,
and another potato; and after that another chop and another
potato.&nbsp; When we had done, he brought me a pudding, and
having set it before me, seemed to ruminate, and to become absent
in his mind for some moments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How&rsquo;s the pie?&rsquo; he said, rousing
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a pudding,&rsquo; I made answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pudding!&rsquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why,
bless me, so it is!&nbsp; What!&rsquo; looking at it
nearer.&nbsp; &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say it&rsquo;s a
batter-pudding?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, it is indeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, a batter-pudding,&rsquo; he said, taking up
a table-spoon, &lsquo;is my favourite pudding.&nbsp; Ain&rsquo;t
that lucky?&nbsp; Come on, little &rsquo;un, and let&rsquo;s see
who&rsquo;ll get most.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The waiter certainly got most.&nbsp; He entreated me
more than once to come in and win, but what with his table-spoon
to my tea-spoon, his despatch to my despatch, and his appetite to
my appetite, I was left far behind at the first mouthful, and had
no chance with him.&nbsp; I never saw any one enjoy a pudding so
much, I think; and he laughed, when it was all gone, as if his
enjoyment of it lasted still.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On his return journey from London, we find him coming down by
&ldquo;The Mail,&rdquo; which stopped at <b>The Star Hotel</b>,
on the Hall Quay, where the bedchamber, &ldquo;The
Dolphin,&rdquo; was assigned for his accommodation.&nbsp; He and
his friend Steerforth, in after visits, <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>frequently
adopted this &ldquo;Royal Mail&rdquo; conveyance, making
headquarters at the &ldquo;Star Hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;volatile&rdquo; <i>Miss Mowcher</i> is first
introduced to us at this establishment.</p>
<p>In chapter 22 we have the full account of David&rsquo;s visit
to Yarmouth in company with Steerforth.&nbsp; They &ldquo;stayed
for more than a fortnight in that part of the country,&rdquo;
during which time Littimer, being in attendance one evening at
this hotel during dinner, informed them that <b>Miss Mowcher</b>
was making one of her professional visits to the town, and
desired an opportunity of waiting on his master.&nbsp; David
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I remained, therefore, in a state of
considerable expectation until the cloth had been removed some
half-an-hour, and we were sitting over our decanter of wine
before the fire, when the door opened, and Littimer, with his
habitual serenity quite undisturbed, announced:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Miss Mowcher!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I looked at the doorway and saw nothing.&nbsp; I was
still looking at the doorway, thinking that Miss Mowcher was a
long while making her appearance, when, to my infinite
astonishment, there came waddling round a sofa which stood
between me and it, a pursy dwarf, of about forty or forty-five,
with a very large head and face, a pair of roguish grey eyes, and
such extremely little arms, that, to enable herself to lay a
finger archly against her snub nose as she ogled Steerforth, she
was obliged to meet the finger half-way, and lay her nose against
it.&nbsp; Her chin, which was what is called a double-chin, was
so fat that it entirely swallowed up the strings of her bonnet,
bow and all.&nbsp; Throat she had none; waist she had none; legs
she had none, worth mentioning; for though she was more than
full-sized down to where her waist would have been, if she had
had any, and though she terminated, as human beings generally do,
in a pair of feet, she was so short that she stood at a
common-sized chair as at a table, resting a bag she carried on
the seat.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Sites Unlocalised</b>.&nbsp; At this distance of time it is
impossible to indicate the locality of &ldquo;<i>The Willing
Mind</i>&rdquo;&mdash;patronised by Mr. Peggotty&mdash;the
residence of <i>Mr. and Mrs. Barkis</i>, or the establishment of
<i>Messrs Omer and Joram</i>.&nbsp; The last is described as
being &ldquo;in a narrow street,&rdquo; and should be doubtless
looked for in the older part of the town.</p>

Perseverance&rdquo;&mdash;Route to Dorking&mdash;Residence of Mr.
and Mrs. Tony Weller&mdash;The &ldquo;Marquis of

Funeral as reported by the <i>Daily News</i>, June
1870&mdash;Poetical Tribute&mdash;The future Outlook.</p>
<p>In the early days of the present century, Nicholas Nickleby
leaving London with Smike, bound for Portsmouth, took the high
road <i>vi&acirc;</i> Kingston and Godalming (with a view, <i>en
passant</i>, of the Devil&rsquo;s Punch-bowl); walking steadily
onward until arrival, on their second day&rsquo;s march, at a
roadside inn&mdash;probably in the neighbourhood of
<i>Horndean</i>.&nbsp; Here they met with Mr. Vincent Crummles,
of histrionic fame, and ended their more immediate perplexities
by an engagement with that gentleman.&nbsp; There was no railway
communication in those times, and coach fare was expensive; but
now-a-days we have adopted a cheaper and more speedy means of
transit, and may reach Portsmouth from London quickly, by two
lines of railroad.</p>
<p>As, in the following excursion, it is proposed to make an
intermediate visit <i>en route</i> to the residence (once on a
time) of Mr. and Mrs. Tony Weller, a journey by coach is
recommended to Dorking, as affording a suitable compliment to Mr.
Weller&rsquo;s memory and profession.&nbsp; A delightful journey
may thus be made by &ldquo;The Perseverance&rdquo; coach, which
starts every week-day during the season, <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>from
Northumberland Avenue, at 10.45 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>,
and travels four-in-hand, <i>vi&acirc;</i> Roehampton, Kingston,
Surbiton, Epsom, Leatherhead, Mickleham, and Boxhill, and arrives
at <b>Dorking</b>, in time for luncheon at the &ldquo;White Horse
Hotel,&rdquo; at which the coach stops.</p>
<p>The interest of this country town centres, for Pickwickian
readers, in the &ldquo;<i>Marquis of Granby</i>,&rdquo; once an
inn.&nbsp; It exists no longer as such, having been long since
converted into a grocer&rsquo;s establishment.&nbsp; It will be
found in the High Street, opposite the Post Office, at the side
of <i>Chequers&rsquo; Court</i>, which runs between it and the
<i>London and County Bank</i>.&nbsp; The old sign-board, the cosy
bar, with its store of choice wines and pine-apple rum (Mr.
Stiggins&rsquo;s &ldquo;pertickler vanity&rdquo;), and the
horse-trough in which the reverend gentleman was half drowned by
the irate Weller, senior, are now among the things that are not;
but the old house still remains <i>in situ</i>, altered to the
uses of its present occupancy.</p>
<p>In chapter 27 of the Pickwick records we read of Sam&rsquo;s
first pilgrimage to Dorking, on which occasion he paid his filial
respects to his mother-in-law, the rather stout lady of
comfortable appearance, who conducted the business of the house;
and made his acquaintance with the Rev. Mr. Stiggins of saintly
memory.&nbsp; The description of the establishment is given as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Marquis of Granby&rsquo; in Mrs.
Weller&rsquo;s time was quite a model of a roadside public-house
of the better class&mdash;just large enough to be convenient, and
small enough to be snug.&nbsp; On the opposite side of the road
was a large sign-board on a high post, representing the head and
shoulders of a gentleman with an apoplectic countenance, in a red
coat with deep-blue facings, and a touch of the same blue over
his three-cornered hat, for a sky.&nbsp; Over that again were a
pair of flags; beneath the last button of his coat were a couple
of cannon; and the whole formed an expressive and undoubted
likeness of the Marquis of Granby of glorious memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bar window displayed a choice collection of
geranium plants, and a well-dusted row of spirit phials.&nbsp;
The open shutters bore a variety of golden inscriptions,
eulogistic of good beds and neat wines; and the choice group of
countrymen and hostlers lounging about the stable-door and
horse-trough, afforded presumptive proof of the excellent <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>quality of
the ale and spirits which were sold within.&nbsp; Sam Weller
paused, when he dismounted from the coach, to note all these
little indications of a thriving business, with the eye of an
experienced traveller; and having done so, stepped in at once,
highly satisfied with everything he had observed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Mr. Stiggins</b>, the clerical friend and spiritual adviser
of the worthy hostess, having fully ingratiated himself in her
good graces, was in the habit of making himself very much at home
at &ldquo;The Marquis&rdquo;; greatly appreciating the creature
comforts there obtainable, and the good liquors kept in
stock.&nbsp; In point of fact, knowing when he was well off, he
lived well&mdash;if not wisely&mdash;on Mrs. Weller&rsquo;s
hospitable bounty, and made headquarters at this Dorking
inn.&nbsp; On the occasion of Sam&rsquo;s first visit before
referred to&mdash;in chapter 27, as above&mdash;this estimable
character is thus introduced to the notice of Pickwickian
students:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He was a prim-faced, red-nosed man, with a
long, thin countenance, and a semi-rattlesnake sort of
eye&mdash;rather sharp, but decidedly bad.&nbsp; He wore very
short trousers, and black-cotton stockings, which, like the rest
of his apparel, were particularly rusty.&nbsp; His looks were
starched, but his white neckerchief was not, and its long limp
ends straggled over his closely-buttoned waistcoat in a very
uncouth and unpicturesque fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fire was blazing brightly under the influence of
the bellows, and the kettle was singing gaily under the influence
of both.&nbsp; A small tray of tea things was arranged on the
table, a plate of hot buttered toast was gently simmering before
the fire, and the red-nosed man himself was busily engaged in
converting a large slice of bread into the same agreeable edible,
through the instrumentality of a long brass toasting-fork.&nbsp;
Beside him stood a glass of reeking hot pine-apple rum and water,
with a slice of lemon in it; and every time the red-nosed man
stopped to bring the round of toast to his eye, with the view of
ascertaining how it got on, he imbibed a drop or two of the hot
pine-apple rum and water, and smiled upon the rather stout lady,
as she blew the fire.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>The downfall of Stiggins</b>.&nbsp; The season of his
prosperity came to a sad ending after the demise of his
patroness; and in chapter 52 we read of his reverse of fortune,
and the final <i>cong&eacute;</i> given to the reverend gentleman
by the irate Mr. Weller, senior, who dismissed him from his <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>household
chaplaincy, in a manner more peremptory than pleasant:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He walked softly into the bar, and
presently returning with the tumbler half full of pine-apple rum,
advanced to the kettle which was singing gaily on the hob, mixed
his grog, stirred it, sipped it, sat down, and taking a long and
hearty pull at the rum and water, stopped for breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The elder Mr. Weller, who still continued to make
various strange and uncouth attempts to appear asleep, offered
not a single word during these proceedings; but when Stiggins
stopped for breath, he darted upon him, and snatching the tumbler
from his hand, threw the remainder of the rum and water in his
face, and the glass itself into the grate.&nbsp; Then, seizing
the reverend gentleman firmly by the collar, he suddenly fell to
kicking him most furiously, accompanying every application of his
top-boots to Mr. Stiggins&rsquo;s person, with sundry violent and
incoherent anathemas upon his limbs, eyes, and body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sammy,&rsquo; said Mr. Weller, &lsquo;put my hat
on tight for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam dutifully adjusted the hat with the long hatband
more firmly on his father&rsquo;s head, and the old gentleman,
resuming his kicking with greater agility than before, tumbled
with Mr. Stiggins through the bar, and through the passage, out
at the front door, and so into the street; the kicking continuing
the whole way, and increasing in vehemence, rather than
diminishing, every time the top-boot was lifted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a beautiful and exhilarating sight to see the
red-nosed man writhing in Mr. Weller&rsquo;s grasp, and his whole
frame quivering with anguish as kick followed kick in rapid
succession; it was a still more exciting spectacle to behold Mr.
Weller, after a powerful struggle, immersing Mr. Stiggins&rsquo;s
head in a horse-trough full of water, and holding it there until
he was half-suffocated.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The old horse-trough, as depicted by &ldquo;Phiz&rdquo; in the
original illustrated title-page of the book, has long since given
place to local alteration and improvement; but &ldquo;hereabouts
it stood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are many pleasant and humorous associations connected
with this old place of country entertainment, as duly set forth
in the Pickwick annals; but it should be remembered that many
years have passed since their publication (1837), and that men
and manners have greatly changed and bettered.&nbsp; It is
satisfactory to reflect that Mr. Stiggins and his brethren have
altogether become obsolete <a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>in English middle-class society, and
that the protest so embodied sixty years since is no longer
necessary.&nbsp; In these happier days, earnestness and ability
have, in the main, superseded laziness and cant.</p>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Dorking to Portsmouth</span>.&nbsp; The
journey being resumed by railway, we travel southward and
westward through the pleasant fields and pasture lands of Sussex,
<i>vi&acirc;</i> Horsham and Chichester, to the old town of
Portsmouth, where, in Landport, Portsea, Charles Dickens was
born, on Friday, the 7th of February 1812.&nbsp; He was the
second son (in a family of eight, six surviving infancy) of Mr.
John Dickens, a clerk in the Navy Pay Office at the
Dockyard.&nbsp; The name of his mother, previous to her marriage,
was Elizabeth Barrow.&nbsp; The baptismal record at Portsea
registers him as <span class="smcap">Charles John Huffham
Dickens</span>, but he very seldom used any other signature than
the one with which we are all familiar.&nbsp; On arrival at the
Portsmouth town station, we leave the railway, turning to the
right, and proceed onwards, in the main thoroughfare of
Commercial Road.&nbsp; Thus we shortly reach, in due course,
<b>The Birthplace of Dickens</b>.&nbsp; The house (No. 387
Commercial Road, Landport) stands about half a mile northward (to
the right) from the railway station, with a neat forecourt.&nbsp;
It bears a tablet recording date of the event, as above.</p>

</a></p>
<p>South of the station (leftward), beyond the Town Hall, will be
found, on the right, <b>The Theatre Royal</b>; but it should be
noted that this is <i>not</i> the establishment referred to in
&ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That old theatre, at which Nicholas&mdash;adopting the
professional <i>alias</i> of &ldquo;Johnson&rdquo;&mdash;made his
histrionic <i>d&eacute;but</i> under the managerial auspices of
Mr. Vincent Crummles, occupied, some eighty years since, the
present site of <b>The Cambridge Barracks</b>, in the <i>High
Street</i>, farther onwards.</p>
<p>We read in the same book that the <i>Crummles</i> family
resided at the house of one Bulph, a pilot; that <i>Miss
Snevellicci</i> had lodgings in Lombard Street, at the house of
<a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>a
tailor, where also <i>Mr. and Mrs. Lillyvick</i> found temporary
accommodation; and that <i>Nicholas</i> and <i>Smike</i> lived in
two small rooms, up three pair of stairs, at a
tobacconist&rsquo;s shop, on the Common Hard.&nbsp; But it is not
possible to particularise these places; indeed, it is altogether
doubtful whether they had any special assignment in the mind of
the author himself.</p>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Leaving Portsmouth, at convenience, by the <i>Brighton and
South Coast Railway</i>, we may take the return journey to London
in about three hours, arriving at the West End Terminus of the
line, <i>Victoria Station</i>.&nbsp; From this point we may
revisit, <i>vi&acirc; Victoria Street</i>, about half a mile in
distance, <b>Westminster Abbey</b>, containing the <span
class="smcap">Tomb of Dickens</span>, which will be found in the
classic shade of the <i>Poets&rsquo; Corner</i>.&nbsp; At the
time of his death the <i>Times</i> &ldquo;took the lead in
suggesting that the only fit resting-place for the remains of a
man so dear to England was the Abbey, in which most illustrious
Englishmen are laid;&rdquo; and accordingly, on the 14th of June,
the funeral took place, with a strict observance of
privacy.&nbsp; In Dean Stanley&rsquo;s &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Westminster Abbey</span>&rdquo; the following
statement is given:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Close under the bust of Thackeray lies
Charles Dickens, not, it may be, his equal in humour, but more
than his equal in his hold on the popular mind, as was shown in
the intense and general enthusiasm shown at his grave.&nbsp; The
funeral, according to Dickens&rsquo;s urgent and express desire
in his will, was strictly private.&nbsp; It took place at an
early hour in the summer morning, the grave having been dug in
secret the night before; and the vast solitary space of the Abbey
was occupied only by the small band of mourners, and the Abbey
clergy, who, without any music except the occasional peal of the
organ, read the funeral service.&nbsp; For days the spot was
visited by thousands; many were the flowers strewn upon it by
unknown hands; many were the tears shed by the poorer
visitors.&nbsp; He rests beside Sheridan, Garrick, and
Henderson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The plain stone covering the tomb is inscribed</p>

147</span><b>Report of the Funeral</b>, as published in the
<i>Daily News</i>, June 15th, 1870:&mdash;&ldquo;Charles Dickens
lies, without one of his injunctions respecting his funeral
having been violated, surrounded by poets and men of
genius.&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s marble effigy looked yesterday
into his open grave; at his feet are Dr. Johnson and David
Garrick; his head is by Addison and Handel; while Oliver
Goldsmith, Rowe, Southey, Campbell, Thomson, Sheridan, Macaulay,
and Thackeray, or their memorials, encircle him; and
&lsquo;Poets&rsquo; Corner,&rsquo; the most familiar spot in the
whole Abbey, has thus received an illustrious addition to its
peculiar glory. . . .&nbsp; Dickens&rsquo;s obsequies were as
simple as he desired.&nbsp; The news that a special train left
Rochester at an early hour yesterday morning, and that it carried
his remains, was soon telegraphed to London; but every
arrangement had been completed beforehand, and there was no one
in the Abbey; no one to follow the three simple mourning coaches
and the hearse; no one to obtrude upon the mourners.&nbsp; The
waiting-room at Charing Cross Station was set apart for the
latter for the quarter of an hour they remained there; the Abbey
doors were closed directly they reached it; and even the mourning
coaches were not permitted to wait.&nbsp; A couple of street cabs
and a single brougham took the funeral party away when the last
solemn rites were over, so that passers-by were unaware that any
ceremony was being conducted; and it was not until a good hour
after that the south transept began to fill.&nbsp; There were no
cloaks, no weepers, no bands, no scarfs, no feathers, none of the
dismal frippery of the undertaker.&nbsp; We yesterday bade the
reader turn to that portion of &lsquo;Great Expectations,&rsquo;
in which the funeral of Joe Gargery&rsquo;s wife is described; he
will there find full details of the miserable things
omitted.&nbsp; In the same part of the same volume he will find
reverent allusion to the time when &lsquo;those noble passages
are read which remind humanity how it brought nothing into the
world and can take nothing out, and how it fleeth like a shadow,
and never continueth long in one stay;&rsquo; and will think of
the solemn scene in Westminster <a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>Abbey, with the Dean reading our
solemn burial service, the organ chiming in, subdued and low, and
the vast place empty, save for the little group of heart-stricken
people by an open grave; a plain oak coffin, with a brass plate
bearing the inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;CHARLES
DICKENS,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Born February 7th, 1812,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Died June 9th, 1870&rsquo;;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>a coffin strewed with wreaths and flowers by the female
mourners; and then dust to dust and ashes to ashes!&nbsp; Such
was the funeral of the great man who has gone.&nbsp; In coming to
the Abbey, in the first coach were the late Mr. Dickens&rsquo;s
children&mdash;Mr. Charles Dickens, jun., Mr. Harry Dickens, Miss
Dickens, Mrs. Charles Collins.&nbsp; In the second coach were
Mrs. Austin, his sister; Mrs. Charles Dickens, jun.; Miss
Hogarth, his sister-in-law; Mr. John Forster.&nbsp; In the third
coach Mr. Frank Beard, his medical attendant; Mr. Charles
Collins, his son-in-law; Mr. Dewey, his solicitor; Mr. Wilkie
Collins; Mr. Edmund Dickens, his nephew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the orders of the Dean of Westminster, the officials
were instructed to keep the grave open until six o&rsquo;clock
last evening, and all who came had the melancholy satisfaction of
seeing not only the grave itself, but the polished oak coffin
which contained the remains of the lamented deceased.&nbsp; A
raised platform was placed around the grave, and two of the
vergers of the Abbey were in attendance to prevent crowding and
preserve order, an almost unnecessary precaution, for all who
came, comprising persons of various classes, conducted themselves
in the most exemplary manner.&nbsp; In the afternoon, when the
fact of the interment became generally known, and that the coffin
was to be seen, the crowds arriving at the Abbey became very
great, and between twelve and six o&rsquo;clock many thousands of
persons had been present.&nbsp; Large numbers paid a simple
tribute to the memory of the deceased by throwing the flowers <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>they wore
in their coat or dress on to the coffin, until, towards the close
of the afternoon, it was completely covered with these simplest
offerings of public affection.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The following <b>Poetical Tribute</b>, <i>in Memoriam</i>,
was, at that sad time, contributed to the public Press, and is
worthy of remembrance:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Artist sleeps, yet friends are here he
gave <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fair dream-children that his fancy drew;<br />
A phantom crowd still gathers at his grave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in each character he lives anew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soft winds of summer breathe along the fane, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The honoured sepulchre where Dickens lies; <br />
An Emigravit write we in our pain&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He is not dead&mdash;the artist never dies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The statesman wins the mantle of a peer, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The warrior boasts all titles of renown; <br />
We leave one laurel only on his bier,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And England&rsquo;s love is greater than a
crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;S.
C.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>So long as the art of printing remains in Society, and the
powers of affection, appreciation, and sympathy survive in the
hearts of Anglo-Saxons&mdash;of the Old World or the
New&mdash;the name and fame of <span class="smcap">Charles
Dickens</span> will be ever held fresh and green amongst
us.&nbsp; And, through the coming summer-dawn of
time&mdash;amidst the destined agencies slowly evolving the
brighter omens of the future&mdash;his genius shall remain
co-operant.&nbsp; For, let us rest assured that &ldquo;the
thoughts of men are widened with the process of the suns&rdquo;;
that the wheel of time is rolling, surely for an end; and that
all worthy labour in the cause of human progress shall become
Immortal, as it helps to make the world purer, gentler, and more
Christian; and hastens onwards the fulfilment of its nobler
destiny.</p>

<p>The various localities referred to in the foregoing <span
class="smcap">Rambles</span> comprise all the more interesting
and better-known points which the Reader of Dickens would most
naturally desire to visit.&nbsp; In addition to these, however,
there are several places mentioned in the many works <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>of
&ldquo;The inimitable Boz&rdquo; which may be enumerated, but
cannot for the following reasons be included in such specified
routes:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) Neighbourhoods have, in course of years, altogether
changed, making it extremely difficult (in many cases impossible)
to specify with exactitude the former situation of old houses,
which have long become part and parcel of the forgotten past,
&ldquo;lost to sight&rdquo; and now only &ldquo;to memory
dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(2) The indications given in the various tales have, in some
cases, been purposely rendered vague and uncertain; it being the
evident aim of the author to avoid precision, and to afford no
definite clue to the position of many places named.</p>
<p>(3) Some of the localities specified are situated at a
considerable distance from any main line of route, and can be
visited only by separate excursion specially undertaken for the
purpose.</p>
<p>In the following addendum these uncertain or distant addresses
are given under the headings of those books in which they
respectively occur; in order that Ramblers, if so disposed,
may&mdash;in the words of Mr.
Peggotty&mdash;&ldquo;fisherate&rdquo; for themselves.</p>
<h3>THE PICKWICK PAPERS.</h3>
<p><b>Mrs. Bardell&rsquo;s House</b> was located in <i>Goswell
Street</i>, certainly in a central position; for we read that, as
Mr. Pickwick looked from his chamber-window on the world
beneath,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Goswell Street was at his feet, Goswell
Street was on his right hand, as far as the eye could reach,
Goswell Street extended on his left, and the opposite side of
Goswell Street was over the way.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>The</b> &ldquo;<b>Spaniards&rsquo; Inn</b>&rdquo; at
<i>Hampstead</i> may be remembered as the scene of the tea-party
at which <i>Mrs. Bardell</i> and a few select friends enjoyed
themselves, previous to her unexpected arrest and removal to the
Fleet Prison, at the suit of <i>Messrs. Dodson and
Fogg</i>.&nbsp; There still exists the &ldquo;Spaniards&rdquo; at
Heath End, Hampstead Heath.</p>
<p><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>[Visitors to Hampstead may be disposed to visit the
site once occupied by Mr. Jones&rsquo;s School, called the
&ldquo;Wellington Academy,&rdquo; at which Dickens received some
two years&rsquo; technical education; being a little over
fourteen years old when he left.&nbsp; The house is now in
possession of the <span class="smcap">Inland Revenue
Office</span>, at the corner of Granby Street, 247 Hampstead
Road; part of the premises abutting on the London and
North-Western Railway, the formation of which demolished the old
schoolroom and playground.]</p>

</a></p>
<h3>OLIVER TWIST.</h3>
<p><b>Mr. Brownlow&rsquo;s Residence</b>, in &ldquo;a quiet shady
street near Pentonville,&rdquo; cannot he fairly localised.&nbsp;
In the days of &ldquo;Oliver Twist,&rdquo; Mr. George Cruikshank,
the illustrator of the book, lived at <i>Myddelton Terrace</i>,
Pentonville; and possibly Dickens bethought himself of this
vicinity in consequence.</p>
<p><b>Fagin&rsquo;s House</b> in <i>Whitechapel</i> and the
residence of <i>Bill Sykes</i> cannot, with any fairness, be
accurately indicated.&nbsp; The latter is spoken of as being in
&ldquo;one of a maze of mean and dirty streets, which abound in
the close and densely populated quarter of Bethnal
Green.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>NICHOLAS NICKLEBY.</h3>
<p><b>The London Tavern</b>, at which was held the Meeting in
promotion of &ldquo;The United Metropolitan Improved Hot Muffin
and Crumpet Baking and Punctual Delivery Company,&rdquo; once
(many years since) occupied the site of the <span
class="smcap">Royal Bank of Scotland</span>, 123 <i>Bishopsgate
Street Within</i>, on the left hand entering the street from
Cornhill.</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Nickleby</b> and her daughter Kate lived, per favour
of their amiable relative, in <i>Thames Street</i>.&nbsp; This
business thoroughfare has undergone considerable reconstruction
since the days of their tenancy, and the particular dwelling
intended cannot be identified.&nbsp; The place is described as a
&ldquo;large, old dingy house, the doors and windows of which
were so bespattered with mud that it would have appeared to have
been uninhabited for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span><b>Mr. Mortimer Knag</b> kept a small circulating
library &ldquo;in a by-street off Tottenham Court Road,&rdquo;
where also lived his sister, <i>Miss Knag</i>, the presiding
genius of Madame Mantalini&rsquo;s establishment; and we may
remember the evening when Mrs. Nickleby and Kate were graciously
invited to supper at this abode of literary genius.</p>
<p><b>The General Agency Office</b>, at which Nicholas Nickleby
obtained the address of <i>Mr. Gregsbury</i>, <i>M.P.</i>,
Manchester Buildings, Westminster (also one of the lost
localities of London), and where he first met <i>Madeline
Bray</i>, has no specified direction in the book.&nbsp; There
have been few such agencies existent in a central position in
London.</p>
<p><b>Messrs. Cheeryble Brothers</b> had their place of business
in a small City square.&nbsp; &ldquo;Passing along Threadneedle
Street, and through some lanes and passages on the right,&rdquo;
we read that Nicholas was conducted by <i>Mr. Charles
Cheeryble</i> to the place in occupation of the firm&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The City square has no enclosure, save the
lamp-post in the middle, and no grass but the weeds which spring
up around its base.&nbsp; It is a quiet, little-frequented,
retired spot, favourable to melancholy and contemplation, and
appointments of long waiting. . . .&nbsp; In winter-time the snow
will linger there long after it has melted from the busy streets
and highways.&nbsp; The summer&rsquo;s sun holds it in some
respect, and while he darts his cheerful rays sparingly into the
square, keeps his fiery heat and glare for noisier and less
imposing precincts.&nbsp; It is so quiet, that you can almost
hear the ticking of your own watch, when you stop to cool in its
refreshing atmosphere.&nbsp; There is a distant hum&mdash;of
coaches, not of insects&mdash;but no other sound disturbs the
stillness of the square.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>The Residence of Mrs. Wititterly</b> is referred to as
having been pleasantly situated in Cadogan Place, Sloane
Street&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Cadogan Place is the one slight bond which
joins two extremities; it is the connecting link between the
aristocratic pavements of Belgrave Square and the barbarism of
Chelsea.&nbsp; It is in Sloane Street, but not of it.&nbsp; The
people of Cadogan Place look down upon Sloane Street, and think
Brompton low.&nbsp; They affect fashion, too, and wonder where
the New Road is.&nbsp; Not that they claim to be on precisely the
same footing as the high folks of Belgrave Square and Grosvenor
Place, but that they stand, in reference to them, rather in the
light of those illegitimate <a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>children of the great, who are
content to boast of their connexions, although their connexions
disavow them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>BARNABY RUDGE.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;<b>The Golden Key</b>&rdquo;&mdash;the house of honest
<i>Gabriel Varden</i>, the locksmith&mdash;was in Clerkenwell,
situated in a quiet street not far from the Charter
House&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A modest building, not very straight, not
large, not tall, not bold-faced, with great staring windows, but
a shy, blinking house, with a conical roof going up into a peak
over its garret window of four small panes of glass, like a
cocked hat on the head of an elderly gentleman with one
eye.&nbsp; It was not built of brick, or lofty stone, but of wood
and plaster; it was not planned with a dull and wearisome regard
to regularity, for no one window matched the other, or seemed to
have the slightest reference to anything beside
itself.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was its description one hundred years ago, and its exact
whereabouts cannot now be ascertained.&nbsp; There are some old
plaster-fronted houses, evidently belonging to the last century,
still to be found in <i>Albemarle Street</i>, near <i>St.
John&rsquo;s Square</i>, but none of these fairly correspond with
the description of &ldquo;The Golden Key.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>The Cellar of Mr. Stagg</b> was situated in
<i>Barbican</i>.&nbsp; We read that its position was &ldquo;in
one of the narrowest of the narrow streets which diverge from
that centre, in a blind court or yard, profoundly dark, unpaved,
and reeking with stagnant odours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<b>The Black Lion</b>&rdquo; <b>Tavern</b> can only be
identified as being situated in Whitechapel.&nbsp; It was a
favourite resort of <i>Mr. John Willett</i>, landlord of the
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Maypole Inn</span>&rdquo; at
<i>Chigwell</i>, when he came to town; and we may remember it as
the scene of <i>Dolly Varden&rsquo;s</i> satisfactory interview
with her lover Joe, after his return from &ldquo;the
Salwanners.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>MARTIN CHUZZLEWIT.</h3>
<p><b>Anthony Chuzzlewit and Son</b> had their place of business
near <i>Aldersgate Street</i>.&nbsp; Their dreary residence was
the bridal home of Mercy Pecksniff&mdash;married by Jonas
Chuzzlewit&mdash;and we may recollect her reception at this
establishment by the worthy <i>Sairey Gamp</i>.&nbsp; To this
house Jonas <a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>returned after the murder of Montague Tigg, and was
here arrested by his relative <i>Chevy Slyme</i>, in the presence
of his uncle and Mark Tapley.&nbsp; Its situation is described as
being in</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A very narrow street, somewhere behind the
Post Office, where every house was in the brightest summer
morning very gloomy; and where light porters watered the
pavement, each before his own employer&rsquo;s premises, in
fantastic patterns in the dog-days; and where spruce gentlemen,
with their hands in the pockets of symmetrical trousers, were
always to be seen in warm weather contemplating their undeniable
boots in dusty warehouse doorways, which appeared to be the
hardest work they did, except now and then carrying pens behind
their ears.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Montague Tigg</b>, <b>Esq.</b>, the Chairman of the
<i>Anglo-Bengalee Insurance Company</i>, lived in luxurious
chambers in <i>Pall Mall</i>; and we may remember the morning
when Jonas Chuzzlewit called at the residence of his chief, and
was disagreeably surprised to find his friend in full possession
of his secret history&mdash;with <i>Mr. Nadgett</i> in
attendance.</p>
<p><b>Tom Pinch</b> and his sister <i>Ruth</i> lodged at
&ldquo;Merry Islington,&rdquo; &ldquo;in a singular little
old-fashioned house, up a blind street,&rdquo; where they were
accommodated with two small bedrooms and a triangular parlour,
the householder being the inscrutable <i>Mr. Nadgett</i>.&nbsp;
In &ldquo;Martin Chuzzlewit&rdquo; are contained many pleasant
episodes associated with these modest apartments; where, as we
all know, little Ruth made her first culinary experiment, and was
pleasantly surprised the next morning to find the merry present
of a cookery-book awaiting her in the parlour (sent by John
Westlock), with the beefsteak pudding leaf turned down and
blotted out.</p>
<h3>DOMBEY AND SON.</h3>
<p><b>Polly Toodles</b> (otherwise Richards) lived with her
husband and her &ldquo;apple-faced&rdquo; family, at
<i>Stagg&rsquo;s Gardens</i>, <i>Camden Town</i>, at the time
when the London and North-Western Railway was in course of
construction&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As yet the neighbourhood was shy to own the
railroad.&nbsp; One or two bold speculators had projected
streets, and one had built a little, <a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>but had stopped among the mud and
ashes to consider further of it.&nbsp; A bran new tavern,
redolent of fresh mortar and size, and fronting nothing at all,
had taken for its sign the &lsquo;Railway Arms;&rsquo; but that
might be rash enterprise&mdash;and then it hoped to sell drink to
the workmen.&nbsp; So the Excavators&rsquo; house of Call had
sprung up from a beer-shop, and the old-established Ham and Beef
Shop had become the Railway Eating House, with a roast leg of
pork daily, through interested motives of a similar immediate and
popular description.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a later chapter of &ldquo;Dombey&rdquo; we read of
Stagg&rsquo;s Gardens having vanished from the earth&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Where the old rotten summer-houses once had
stood, palaces now reared their heads, and granite columns of
gigantic girth opened a vista to the railway world beyond.&nbsp;
The miserable waste ground, where the refuse matter had been
heaped of yore, was swallowed up and gone, and in its frowzy
stead were tiers of warehouses, crammed with rich goods and
costly merchandise.&nbsp; The old bye-streets now swarmed with
passengers and vehicles of every kind: the new streets that had
stopped disheartened in the mud and waggon-ruts, formed towns
within themselves, originating wholesome comforts and
conveniences belonging to themselves, and never tried nor thought
of until they sprung into existence.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Miss Lucretia Tox</b> had apartments at <i>Princess
Place</i>, an address not included in the London Directory; and
<i>Major Bagstock</i> also had chambers in the immediate
vicinity, a genteel but somewhat inconvenient
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Miss Tox&rsquo;s residence is described
as</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A dark little house, that had been squeezed
at some remote period of English history into a fashionable
neighbourhood at the west end of the town, where it stood in the
shade, like a poor relation of the great street round the corner,
coldly looked down upon by mighty mansions.&nbsp; It was not
exactly in a court, and it was not exactly in a yard, but it was
in the dullest of No-Thoroughfares, rendered anxious and haggard
by double knocks. . . .&nbsp; There is a smack of stabling in the
air of Princess Place, and Miss Tox&rsquo;s bedroom (which was at
the back) commanded a vista of mews, where hostlers, at whatever
sort of work engaged, were continually accompanying themselves
with effervescent noises, and where the most domestic and
confidential garments of coachmen and their wives and families
usually hung like Macbeth&rsquo;s banners on the outer
walls.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Mrs. MacStinger</b> presided at <i>No. 9 Brig Place</i>,
finding accommodation for <i>Captain Cuttle</i> as her first
floor lodger, <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>previous to the time of his hurried and secret removal
to the quarters of <i>The Wooden Midshipman</i>.&nbsp; We read
that the house was situated</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On the brink of a little canal near the
India Docks, where the air was perfumed with chips, and all other
trades were swallowed up in mast, oar, and block making, and boat
building.&nbsp; Then the ground grew marshy and unsettled.&nbsp;
Then there was nothing to be smelt but rum and sugar.&nbsp; Then
Captain Cuttle&rsquo;s lodgings, at once a first floor and a top
storey, in Brig Place, were close before you.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>DAVID COPPERFIELD.</h3>
<p><b>Mr. Creakle&rsquo;s</b> educational establishment,
&ldquo;<i>Salem House</i>,&rdquo; was, we are told, &ldquo;down
by Blackheath.&rdquo;&nbsp; A large, dull house, standing away
from the main road among some dark trees, and surrounded by a
high wall.&nbsp; The character of Mr. Creakle seems to have been
drawn from life; being, in fact, a portrait of the proprietor of
the &ldquo;<i>Wellington Academy</i>,&rdquo; Hampstead Road,
previously referred to.&nbsp; <i>Dr. Danson</i>, an old
schoolfellow of Dickens, writing to Mr. Forster, states that this
&ldquo;Mr. Jones was a Welshman, a most ignorant fellow, and a
mere tyrant, whose chief employment was to scourge the
boys.&rdquo;&nbsp; Also, Mr. Forster, speaking of the school,
says, &ldquo;it had supplied some of the lighter traits of Salem
House for &lsquo;Copperfield.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Mr. Micawber</b> lived in Windsor Terrace, City Road, at
the time he first received young David Copperfield as a lodger,
and previous to the crisis in his pecuniary affairs which removed
him to <span class="smcap">King&rsquo;s Bench Prison</span> in
the Borough.</p>
<p>We also read, later in the book, of the Micawbers as located
in a little street near <i>The Veterinary College</i>, <i>Camden
Town</i>, what time <i>Mr. Traddles</i> was their lodger; and we
may remember how the astute Mr. Micawber took advantage of the
circumstance, by obtaining the friendly signature of his inmate
as security, in the matter of two bills &ldquo;not provided
for.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Mrs. Steerforth</b> resided in &ldquo;an old brick house at
<i>Highgate</i>, on the summit of the hill; a genteel,
old-fashioned house, very quiet, and very orderly,&rdquo; from
which position a <a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>comprehensive view was obtainable of &ldquo;all London
lying in the distance like a great vapour, with here and there
some lights twinkling through it.&rdquo;&nbsp; In connection with
this house we may recall the characters of <i>Rosa Dartle</i> and
the respectable serving-man <i>Littimer</i>.</p>
<p><b>Doctor and Mrs. Strong</b> also lived in a cottage at
Highgate after their removal from Canterbury; and <i>Mr. and Mrs.
David Copperfield</i> resided in the same neighbourhood, with
<i>Betsy Trotwood</i> established in a convenient cottage near at
hand.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Traddles</b>, in his bachelor days, had lodgings behind
the parapet of a house in <i>Castle Street</i>,
<i>Holborn</i>.&nbsp; This thoroughfare has now changed its name,
and is known as <span class="smcap">Furnival Street</span>.&nbsp;
It may be found on the south side of Holborn, and west of Fetter
Lane, leading to Cursitor Street.</p>
<h3>BLEAK HOUSE.</h3>
<p><b>Mr. Guppy</b> mentioned his address as 87 <i>Penton
Place</i>, <i>Pentonville</i>; but the London Directory does not
now include the number specified.&nbsp; The residence of <i>Mrs.
Guppy</i>, his mother, is stated as having been 302 <i>Old Street
Road</i>; previous to the time when a house was taken (by mother
and son) in <i>Walcot Square</i>, <i>Lambeth</i>, on the south
side of the Thames, and Mr. Guppy started on his independent
professional career.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Jarndyce</b> once sojourned in London, &ldquo;at a
cheerful lodging near <i>Oxford Street</i>, over an
upholsterer&rsquo;s shop,&rdquo; at which also Ada Clare and
Esther Summerson were accommodated.</p>
<p><b>Mr. and Mrs. Smallweed</b> vegetated, with their
grandchildren, &ldquo;in a rather ill-favoured and ill-savoured
neighbourhood, though one of its rising grounds bears the name of
<i>Mount Pleasant</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This beatific neighbourhood
will be found north of <i>Clerkenwell Road</i> (approached by
<i>Laystall Street</i>), in the neighbourhood of the <span
class="smcap">Middlesex House of Correction</span>.</p>
<p><b>George&rsquo;s Shooting Gallery</b> is memorable as the
place <a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>where <i>Gridley</i>&mdash;&ldquo;the man from
Shropshire&rdquo;&mdash;died; where also <i>Poor Jo</i>, clinging
to the spars of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, drifted out upon the
unknown sea.&nbsp; It is described as &ldquo;a great brick
building, composed of bare walls, floors, roof-rafters, and
skylights; on the front of which was painted
&lsquo;George&rsquo;s Shooting Gallery.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Its
location is given as being up a court and a long whitewashed
passage, in</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That curious region lying about the
Haymarket and Leicester Square, which is a centre of attraction
to indifferent foreign hotels and indifferent foreigners, racket
courts, fighting men, swordsmen, foot-guards, old china,
gambling-houses, exhibitions, and a large medley of shabbiness
and shrinking out of sight.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Mr. Bagnet</b> and his &ldquo;old girl&rdquo; kept house
and home on the Surrey side of the river; but no more precise
indication of their whereabouts is given than is contained in the
following reference:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;By Blackfriars&rsquo; Bridge, and
Blackfriars&rsquo; Road, Mr. George sedately marches to a street
of little shops lying somewhere in that ganglion of roads from
Kent and Surrey, and of streets from the bridges of London,
centreing in the far-famed Elephant who has lost his
castle.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>The Town House of Sir Leicester</b> and Lady Dedlock was
situated in a dull aristocratic street in the western district of
London,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Where the two long rows of houses stare at
each other with that severity, that half-a-dozen of its greatest
mansions seem to have been slowly stared into stone, rather than
originally built in that material.&nbsp; It is a street of such
dismal grandeur, so determined not to condescend to liveliness,
that the doors and windows hold a gloomy state of their own in
black paint and dust, and the echoing mews behind have a dry and
massive appearance, as if they were reserved to stable the stone
chargers of noble statues.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Harold Skimpole</b> and family had their residence in the
<i>Polygon</i>, near to the <span class="smcap">Euston
Terminus</span> (on the east side), in the centre of <i>Clarendon
Square</i>, <i>Somers Town</i>.&nbsp; The house is described as
being sadly in want of repair&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Two or three of the area railings were
gone; the water-butt was broken; the knocker was loose; the
bell-handle had been pulled off a long time, to judge from the
rusty state of the wire; and dirty footprints on the steps were
the only signs of its being inhabited.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>LITTLE DORRIT.</h3>
<p><b>The House of Mrs. Clennam</b> was situated not far from the
river, in the neighbourhood of <i>Upper Thames Street</i>.&nbsp;
We read that Arthur Clennam, on his arrival in London,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Crossed by Saint Paul&rsquo;s and went
down, at a long angle, almost to the water&rsquo;s edge, through
some of the crooked and descending streets which lie (and lay
more crookedly and closely then) between the river and Cheapside
. . . passing silent warehouses and wharves, and here and there a
narrow alley leading to the river, where a wretched little bill,
&lsquo;Found Drowned,&rsquo; was weeping on the wet wall; he came
at last to the house he sought.&nbsp; An old brick house, so
dingy as to be all but black, standing by itself within a
gateway.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Mr. Tite Barnacle</b> had his residence in <i>Mews
Street</i>, <i>Grosvenor Square</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It was a hideous little street of dead
wall, stables, and dunghills, with lofts over coach-houses
inhabited by coachmen&rsquo;s families, who had a passion for
drying clothes, and decorating their window-sills with miniature
turnpike-gates.&nbsp; The principal chimney-sweep of that
fashionable quarter lived at the blind end of Mews Street. . .
.&nbsp; Yet there were two or three small airless houses at the
entrance end of Mews Street, which went at enormous rents on
account of their being abject hangers-on to a fashionable
situation; and whenever one of these fearful little coops was to
be let (which seldom happened, for they were in great request),
the house agent advertised it as a gentlemanly residence in the
most aristocratic part of the town, inhabited solely by the
&eacute;lite of the beau monde.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>The Patriarchal Casby</b>, with his daughter&mdash;the
irrepressible <i>Flora</i>&mdash;and <i>Mr. F.&rsquo;s
Aunt</i>,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lived in a street in the Gray&rsquo;s Inn
Road, which had set off from that thoroughfare with the intention
of running at one heat down into the valley, and up again to the
top of Pentonville Hill; but which had run itself out of breath
in twenty yards, and had stood still ever since.&nbsp; There is
no such place in that part now; but it remained there for many
years, looking with a baulked countenance at the wilderness
patched with unfruitful gardens, and pimpled with eruptive
summer-houses, that it had meant to run over in no
time.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>TALE OF TWO CITIES.</h3>
<p>In this Tale we read of the funeral of <i>Cly</i>, the Old
Bailey Informer; the interment taking place in the burial-ground
attached to the ancient church of <a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span><b>St. Pancras in the
Fields</b>.&nbsp; This edifice still exists in <span
class="smcap">Pancras Road</span> (east side, opposite
<i>Goldington Crescent</i>), which leads from King&rsquo;s Cross,
northward, to Kentish Town.&nbsp; There is a church of the same
name to be found in the <span class="smcap">Euston
Road</span>&mdash;east of <i>Upper Woburn Place</i>, but this is
altogether another and more modern structure than the one above
referred to.&nbsp; A century since, at the time of the funeral
described, the name of this locality was literally correct; the
church being situated in the outlying fields of the suburban
village of <span class="smcap">Pancras</span>.&nbsp; We may here
recollect the fishing expedition undertaken by <i>Mr.
Cruncher</i> and his two companions, on the night following the
funeral; when young <i>Jerry</i> quietly followed his
&ldquo;honoured parent,&rdquo; and assured himself of the nature
of his father&rsquo;s secret avocation.</p>
<h3>GREAT EXPECTATIONS.</h3>
<p><b>Mr. Jaggers</b>, the Old Bailey lawyer, had his private
residence on the south side of <i>Gerrard Street</i>,
<i>Soho</i>, where he lived in solitary state, with his eccentric
housekeeper, the mother of Estella: &ldquo;Rather a stately house
of its kind, but dolefully in want of painting, and with dirty
windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Wemmick&rsquo;s Castle</b> at <i>Walworth</i> is altogether
a place of the past; Walworth being now one of the most populous
and crowded of metropolitan districts.&nbsp; We read that in
Pip&rsquo;s time</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It appeared to be a collection of black
lanes, ditches, and little gardens, and to present the aspect of
a rather dull retirement.&nbsp; Wemmick&rsquo;s house was a
little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of garden, and the
top of it was cut out and painted like a battery mounted with
guns.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Mr. Barley</b>, <i>alias Old Gruff-and-Glum</i>, lived at
<i>Mill Pond Bank</i>, by Chinks&rsquo;s Basin and the Old Green
Copper Rope-walk.&nbsp; Pip says the place was anything but easy
to find.&nbsp; Losing himself among shipbuilders&rsquo; and
shipbreakers&rsquo; yards, he continues the description of his
search as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;After several times falling short of my
destination, and as often overshooting it, I came unexpectedly
round a corner, upon Mill Pond <a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>Bank.&nbsp; It was a fresh kind of
place, all circumstances considered, where the wind from the
river had room to turn itself round; and there were two or three
trees in it, and there was the stump of a ruined windmill, and
there was the Old Green Copper Rope-walk&mdash;whose long and
narrow vista I could trace in the moonlight, along a series of
wooden frames set in the ground, that looked like superannuated
haymaking rakes, which had grown old and lost most of their
teeth.&nbsp; Selecting from the few queer houses upon Mill Pond
Bank, a house with a wooden front and three storeys of bow-window
(not bay-window, which is another thing), I looked at the plate
upon the door, and read there Mrs. Whimple . . . the name I
wanted.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>OUR MUTUAL FRIEND.</h3>
<p><b>The House of Gaffer Hexam</b>, the humble home of <i>Lizzie
Hexam</i> and her brother, was situated somewhere in the district
of <i>Limehouse</i>, near the river.&nbsp; In a description given
of the route by which Messrs. Lightwood and Wrayburn approached
this locality, we read&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Down by the Monument, and by the Tower, and
by the Docks; down by Ratcliffe, and by Rotherhithe. . . .&nbsp;
In and out among vessels that seemed to have got ashore, and
houses that seemed to have got afloat&mdash;among bowsprits
staring into windows, and windows staring into ships&mdash;the
wheels rolled on, until they stopped at a dark corner,
river-washed and otherwise not washed at all, where the boy
alighted and opened the door.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<b>The Six Jolly Fellowship Porters</b>&rdquo; was
located in this same vicinity, overlooking the river.&nbsp; A
waterside public-house, kept by <i>Miss Abbey Patterson</i>, who
enforced a certain standard of respectability among her numerous
clients, and conducted the house with a strict regard to
discipline and punctuality&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Externally, it was a narrow, lop-sided,
wooden jumble of corpulent windows heaped one upon another, as
you might heap as many toppling oranges, with a crazy wooden
verandah impending over the water; indeed, the whole house,
inclusive of the complaining flagstaff on the roof, impended over
the water, but seemed to have got into the condition of a
faint-hearted diver who has paused so long on the brink that he
will never go in at all. . . .&nbsp; The back of the
establishment, though the chief entrance, was there so contracted
that it merely represented, in its connection with the front, the
handle of a flat iron set upright on its broadest end.&nbsp; This
handle stood at the bottom of a wilderness of court and alley;
which wilderness pressed so hard and <a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>close upon the &lsquo;Six Jolly
Fellowship Porters,&rsquo; as to leave the hostelry not an inch
of ground beyond its door.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Rogue Riderhood</b> and his daughter <i>Pleasant</i> traded
at <i>Limehouse Hole</i>, in the same district as above, where
they kept &ldquo;a leaving shop&rdquo; for sailors; advancing
small sums of money on the portable property of seafaring
customers.&nbsp; Mr. Riderhood did not stand well in the esteem
of the neighbourhood, which &ldquo;was rather shy in reference to
the honour of cultivating&rdquo; his acquaintance, his daughter
being the more respectable and respected member of the firm.</p>
<p>Mr. Twemlow, &ldquo;an innocent piece of dinner
furniture,&rdquo; often in request in certain West-end circles of
society, lodged in <i>Duke Street</i>, <i>St. James&rsquo;s</i>,
&ldquo;over a livery stable-yard.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>The Location of the Veneering Family</b> is described as
&ldquo;a bran-new house, in a bran-new quarter,&rdquo; designated
by the appellation of &ldquo;<i>Stucconia</i>;&rdquo; while their
intimate friends <b>The Podsnaps</b> flourished &ldquo;in a shady
angle adjoining <i>Portman Square</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Boffin&rsquo;s Bower</b>, the home in which we are first
introduced to the Golden Dustman and his wife, was to be found
&ldquo;about a mile and a quarter up Maiden Lane, Battle
Bridge,&rdquo; in the close vicinity of the Mounds of Dust for
which Mr. Harman was the contractor.</p>
<p><b>The Location of Mr. R. Wilfer</b> and family was in the
northern district of <i>Holloway</i>, beyond Battle Bridge,
divided therefrom by &ldquo;a tract of suburban Sahara, where
tiles and bricks were burnt, bones were boiled, carpets were
beat, rubbish was shot, dogs were fought, and dust was heaped by
contractors.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>The Establishment of Mr. Venus</b> was in
<i>Clerkenwell</i>, among</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The poorer shops of small retail traders in
commodities to eat and drink and keep folks warm, and of Italian
frame-makers, and of barbers, and of brokers, and of dealers in
dogs and singing-birds.&nbsp; From these, in a narrow and a dirty
street devoted to such callings, Mr. Wegg selects one dark
shop-window with a tallow candle dimly burning in it, surrounded
by a muddle of objects vaguely resembling pieces <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>of leather
and dry stick, but among which nothing is resolvable into
anything distinct, save the candle itself in its old tin
candlestick, and two preserved frogs fighting a small-sword
duel.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>THE MYSTERY OF EDWIN DROOD.</h3>
<p>In the first chapter of the tale we are introduced to
&ldquo;the meanest and closest of small rooms,&rdquo; where,
&ldquo;through the ragged window-curtain, the light of early day
steals in from a miserable court.&rdquo;&nbsp; A man</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lies dressed, across a large unseemly bed,
upon a bedstead that has indeed given way under the weight upon
it.&nbsp; Lying, also dressed, and also across the bed, not
longwise, are a Chinaman, a Lascar, and a haggard woman.&nbsp;
The two first are in a sleep or stupor; the last is blowing at a
kind of pipe, to kindle it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This <b>Opium Smokers&rsquo; Den</b> had its location in an
eastern district of London, probably the <i>Shadwell</i>
neighbourhood of the <span class="smcap">London Docks</span>, but
no precise indication of its whereabouts is given in the
tale.&nbsp; We read of John Jasper starting from his hotel in
<i>Falcon Square</i>: &ldquo;Eastward, and still eastward,
through the stale streets, he takes his way, until he reaches his
destination&mdash;a miserable court, specially miserable among
many such.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>THE SOUTH KENSINGTON MUSEUM</h3>
<p>is readily attainable from <i>Charing Cross</i> (or any other)
station of the <i>District Metropolitan Railway</i>.&nbsp;
Entrance in <i>Cromwell Road</i>, five minutes&rsquo; walk, on
the north side, from South Kensington Station.</p>
<p><b>The Forster Collection</b>&mdash;on the first
floor&mdash;in this museum contains several of the earlier <span
class="smcap">Letters</span> written by Dickens to Forster, and
the pen-and-ink sketch by <i>Maclise</i>, representing the
&ldquo;Apotheosis of &lsquo;Grip,&rsquo;&rdquo; the celebrated
Raven, who departed this life at No. 1 Devonshire Terrace, March
12th, 1841.&nbsp; There are also here exhibited <b>The
Manuscripts</b> of the principal <span class="smcap">Works of
Dickens</span>, together with a <i>Proof Copy</i> of &ldquo;David
Copperfield,&rdquo; showing the corrections of the Author.&nbsp;
Most of these lie <a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>opened, each at its first page; and it is interesting
to observe the careful interlineations and alterations with which
the various original copies were amended.&nbsp; In the case of
&ldquo;The Mystery of Edwin Drood,&rdquo; the sorrowful memento
of its final page is exposed to view, as being the last sheet
written by the &ldquo;vanished hand&rdquo; of our much loved and
faithful friend,</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
